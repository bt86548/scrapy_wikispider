,
,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,.,[1],[2], Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

,
,History,[,edit,],
,Developer ,Wes McKinney, started working on pandas in 2008 while at ,AQR Capital Management, out of the need for a high performance, flexible tool to perform ,quantitative analysis, on financial data. Before leaving AQR he was able to convince management to allow him to ,open source, the library.
,Another AQR employee, Chang She, joined the effort in 2012 as the second major contributor to the library.
,In 2015, pandas signed on as a fiscally sponsored project of ,NumFOCUS,, a ,501(c)(3) nonprofit charity, in the United States.,[6],

,Bram Moolenaar, (born 1961, ,Lisse,) is a ,Dutch, ,computer programmer, and an active member of the ,open-source software, community. He is the original author, maintainer, ,release manager,, and ,benevolent dictator for life, of ,Vim,,,[1], a ,vi,-derivative text editor that is very popular among programmers and ,power users,. Since July 2006, Moolenaar has been employed by ,Google,,,[2],[3], working in the ,Zürich, office.,[4], He is able to spend part of his time maintaining Vim.,[2],

,Charity work and awards,[,edit,],
,Moolenaar is an advocate of the ,ICCF, charity, encouraging people to support orphans in ,Uganda,. He pioneered a methodology called ,charityware, through ,Vim,.,[5], The software itself is available for free, but it encourages the user to donate to the programmer's favorite charity.,[6], A number of other applications have been licensed this way since the inception of this concept.,[7], The opening ""splash"" screen for Vim encourages support of ICCF.
,Moolenaar has been a member of the Dutch Unix user group, ,NLUUG,, which presented him with an award,[8], during its 25th anniversary, for his creation of Vim and his contributions to open source software in general.
,
,Vim,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Vim (text editor),
,The Vim editor started as ""Vi IMitation"" on the ,Amiga, in 1988, but was later relabeled ""Vi IMproved"",[9], and ported to many other platforms. As ,vi, was a popular editor amongst programmers and system administrators, initially there was doubt whether Bram's 'improved' version could achieve the quality and fan following of the original. But since its first release for Unix systems in 1992, Vim has effectively eclipsed the original Vi, having won several awards,[10], and has been referred to as one of the most popular text editors.,[11],[12],[13],
,
,Other software,[,edit,],
,Other software tools that Moolenaar has developed include a software build tool written in ,Python,, called ,A-A-P,,,[14], which is similar to ,make,, and a programming language called ,Zimbu,[15], which puts an emphasis on readability of programs.  Bram is also an assurer for the ,non-profit, ,certificate authority, ,CAcert,, which means that he is eligible to verify the identities of people using the CAcert ,web of trust, model. Amongst all of Moolenaar's contributions to the field of computer science, the Vim editor remains his most prominent and widely used application.

,

,Early life and education,[,edit,],
,Mullenweg was born in ,Houston,, Texas, and attended the ,High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, where he studied jazz ,saxophone,.,[4], He studied at the ,University of Houston,, majoring in ,Political Science,, before he dropped out in 2004 to pursue a job at ,CNET Networks,.,[5],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,  ,Mullenweg at WordCamp Germany 2009,
,In January 2003, Mullenweg and ,Mike Little, started ,WordPress, from the b2 codebase. They were soon joined by original b2 developer Michel Valdrighi. Mullenweg was 19 years old, and a freshman at the ,University of Houston, at the time.,[6],[7], He co-founded the ,Global Multimedia Protocols Group, (GMPG) in March 2004 with ,Eric Meyer, and ,Tantek Çelik,. GMPG wrote the first of the ,Microformats,. In April 2004, with fellow WordPress developer, they launched Ping-O-Matic, a hub for notifying blog ,search engines, like ,Technorati, about blog updates.,[8], The following month, WordPress competitor ,Movable Type, announced a radical price change, driving thousands of users to seek another blogging platform; this is widely seen as the tipping point for WordPress.,[9],
,In October 2004, he was recruited by CNET to work on WordPress for them and help them with blogs and new media offerings.,[10], He dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco from ,Houston,, Texas, the following month. Mullenweg announced bbPress in December,,[11], Mullenweg and the ,WordPress, team released WordPress 1.5 ""Strayhorn"" in February 2005, which had over 900,000 downloads.,[12], The release introduced their theme system, moderation features, and a redesign of the front and back end. In late March and early April, Andrew Baio found at least 168,000 hidden articles on the WordPress.org website that were using a technique known as ,cloaking,.,[13], Mullenweg admitted accepting the questionable advertisement and removed all articles from the domain.,[14],
,Mullenweg left CNET in October 2005 to focus on WordPress and related activities full-time,,[15], and announced ,Akismet, several days later.,[16], Akismet is a distributed effort to stop ,comment and trackback spam, by using the collective input of everyone using the service. In December, he announced Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and Akismet. Automattic employed people who had contributed to the WordPress project, including lead developer ,Ryan Boren, and WordPress MU creator Donncha Ó Caoimh. An Akismet licensing deal,[17], and WordPress bundling,[18], was announced with ,Yahoo!, Small Business web hosting about the same time.
,
,  ,Mullenweg at WordCamp Bulgaria 2011,
,In January 2006 Mullenweg recruited former ,Oddpost, CEO and ,Yahoo!, executive Toni Schneider to join Automattic as CEO, bringing the size of the company to 5. An April 2007 ,Regulation D, filing showed that Automattic raised approximately $1.1 million.,[19], Investors were ,Polaris Ventures,, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and CNET.
,Mullenweg runs an angel investment firm Audrey Capital, which has backed nearly 30 companies since 2008.,[20], In 2011 he backed ,Y Combinator, startup ,Earbits,.,[21],
,In January 2008 Automattic raised an additional $29.5 million for the company from ,Polaris Venture Partners,, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and the New York Times Company.,[22], According to Mullenweg's blog the funding was a result of spurned acquisition offers months before and the decision to keep the company independent. At the time the company had 18 employees.,[23], One of the reported plans for the funding was in a forum service called TalkPress.,[24],
,In January 2009, the ,San Francisco Business Times, reported that traffic to WordPress sites were growing faster than for Google's blogger service and significantly outstripped its nearest competitor, ,Six Apart,. A reporter at ,eMarketer, called Mullenweg ""quite an entrepreneur and visionary"" and compared WordPress' momentum over its competitors to Facebook's growing popularity over ,MySpace,.,[25],
,In February 2009, an interview with ,Power Magazine, called Mullenweg ""the Blog Prince"" and dispelled the myth that blogging was a passing trend and revealed that the company has seen a 10% month-on-month organic growth with more than 15,000 new blogs hosted by WordPress each day.,[26],
,In May 2009, Mullenweg's unwillingness to comply with Chinese censorship meant WordPress.com was effectively blocked by China's ,Golden Shield Project,.,[27],
,A ,Bloomberg, interview in April 2011 described the impressive scalability of the company. Monthly infrastructure costs were only $300,000 to $400,000 while powering 12% of the internet with 1,350 servers and 80 employees in 62 cities. The management of the global company excludes all internal email but instead communication is rooted in their P2theme.com blog theme.,[28],

,History,[,edit,],
,Taylor Otwell, created Laravel as an attempt to provide a more advanced alternative to the ,CodeIgniter, framework, which did not provide certain features such as built-in support for user ,authentication, and ,authorization,.  Laravel's first ,beta release, was made available on June 9, 2011, followed by the Laravel 1 release later in the same month.  Laravel 1 included built-in support for authentication, ,localisation,, ,models,, ,views,, ,sessions,, routing and other mechanisms, but lacked support for ,controllers, that prevented it from being a true ,MVC, framework.,[1],
,Laravel 2 was released in September 2011, bringing various improvements from the author and community.  Major new features included the support for controllers, which made Laravel 2 a fully MVC-compliant framework, built-in support for the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, and a ,templating system, called ,Blade,.  As a downside, support for third-party ,packages, was removed in Laravel 2.,[1],
,Laravel 3 was released in February 2012 with a set of new features including the ,command-line interface, (CLI) named ,Artisan,, built-in support for more ,database management systems,, database migrations as a form of ,version control, for database layouts, support for handling ,events,, and a packaging system called ,Bundles,.  An increase of Laravel's userbase and popularity lined up with the release of Laravel 3.,[1],
,Laravel 4, codenamed ,Illuminate,, was released in May 2013.  It was made as a complete rewrite of the Laravel framework, migrating its layout into a set of separate packages distributed through ,Composer,, which serves as an ,application-level package manager,.  Such a layout improved the extensibility of Laravel 4, which was paired with its official regular release schedule spanning six months between minor ,point releases,.  Other new features in the Laravel 4 release include ,database seeding, for the initial population of databases, support for ,message queues,, built-in support for sending different types of email, and support for delayed deletion of database records called ,soft deletion,.,[1],[9],:,18–19,
,Laravel 5 was released in February 2015 as a result of internal changes that ended up in renumbering the then-future Laravel 4.3 release.  New features in the Laravel 5 release include support for scheduling periodically executed tasks through a package called ,Scheduler,, an abstraction layer called ,Flysystem, that allows remote storage to be used in the same way as local ,file systems,, improved handling of package assets through ,Elixir,, and simplified externally handled authentication through the optional ,Socialite, package. Laravel 5 also introduced a new internal ,directory tree, structure for developed applications.,[5],:,13–14,[10],
,Laravel 5.1, released in June 2015, was the first release of Laravel to receive ,long-term support, (LTS). New LTS versions were planned for one every two years.,[11],
,Laravel 5.3 was released on August 23, 2016. The new features in 5.3 are focused on improving developer speed by adding additional out of the box improvements for common tasks.,[12],
,Laravel 5.4 was released on January 24, 2017, with many new features like Laravel Dusk, Laravel Mix, Blade Components and Slots, Markdown Emails, Automatic Facades, Route Improvements, Higher Order Messaging for Collections, and many others.,[13],
,Laravel 6.0 was released on September 3, 2019, shift blueprint code generation, introducing semantic versioning, compatibility with Laravel Vapor, improved authorization responses, improved job middleware, lazy collections, and sub-query improvements. The frontend scaffolding was removed from the main package and moved into the laravel/ui package.,[14],
,Laravel 7.0 was released on March 3, 2020, with new features like Laravel Sanctum, Custom Eloquent Casts, Blade Component Tags, Fluent String Operations and Route Model Binding Improvements. ,[15],
,
,Release history,[,edit,],
,Versions designated LTS are supported with bug fixes for 2 years and security fixes for 3 years. Other releases are supported with bug fixes for 6 months and security fixes for 1 year.,[16],

,
,Features,[,edit,],
,The following features serve as Laravel's key design points (where not specifically noted, descriptions refer to the features of Laravel 3):,[4],[5],:,5–9,[6],[7],[30],
,
,Bundles, provide a modular ,packaging system, since the release of Laravel 3, with bundled features already available for easy addition to applications.  Furthermore, Laravel 4 uses Composer as a dependency manager to add framework-agnostic and Laravel-specific PHP packages available from the ,Packagist, repository.,[31],
,Eloquent ORM, (,object-relational mapping,) is an advanced PHP implementation of the ,active record pattern,, providing at the same time internal methods for enforcing constraints on the relationships between ,database, objects.  Following the active record pattern, Eloquent ORM presents ,database tables, as ,classes,, with their ,object instances, tied to single ,table rows,.,[32],
,Query builder,, available since Laravel 3, provides a more direct database access alternative to the Eloquent ORM.  Instead of requiring ,SQL queries, to be written directly, Laravel's query builder provides a set of classes and ,methods, capable of building queries programmatically.  It also allows selectable ,caching, of the results of executed queries.,[33],
,Application logic, is an integral part of developed applications, implemented either by using ,controllers, or as part of the route declarations.  The ,syntax, used to define application logic is similar to the one used by ,Sinatra, framework.,
,Reverse routing, defines a relationship between the links and routes, making it possible for later changes to routes to be automatically propagated into relevant links.  When the links are created by using names of existing routes, the appropriate ,uniform resource identifiers, (URIs) are automatically created by Laravel.,
,Restful controllers, provide an optional way for separating the logic behind serving ,HTTP GET, and ,POST, requests.,
,Class auto loading, provides automated loading of PHP classes without the need for manual maintenance of inclusion paths.  On-demand loading prevents inclusion of unnecessary components, so only the actually used components are loaded.,
,View, composers, serve as customizable logical code units that can be executed when a view is loaded.,
,Blade, ,templating engine, combines one or more templates with a ,data model, to produce resulting views, doing that by ,transpiling, the templates into cached PHP code for improved performance.  Blade also provides a set of its own ,control structures, such as ,conditional statements, and ,loops,, which are internally mapped to their PHP counterparts.  Furthermore, Laravel services may be called from Blade templates, and the templating engine itself can be extended with custom directives.,[34],[35],
,IoC containers, make it possible for new objects to be generated by following the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, in which the framework calls into the application- or task-specific code, with optional instantiating and referencing of new objects as ,singletons,.,
,Migrations, provide a ,version control, system for ,database schemas,, making it possible to associate changes in the application's ,codebase, and required changes in the database layout.  As a result, this feature simplifies the ,deployment, and updating of Laravel-based applications.,[36],
,Database seeding, provides a way to populate database tables with selected default data that can be used for application ,testing, or be performed as part of the initial application setup.,[36],
,Unit testing, is provided as an integral part of Laravel,,[9],:,61–62, which itself contains unit tests that detect and prevent ,regressions, in the framework.  Unit tests can be run through the provided ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},artisan, ,command-line utility,.,
,Automatic pagination, simplifies the task of implementing pagination, replacing the usual manual implementation approaches with automated methods integrated into Laravel.,
,Form request, is a feature of Laravel 5 that serves as the base for ,form, input validation by internally binding ,event, listeners, resulting in automated invoking of the form validation methods and generation of the actual form.,[37],
,Homestead, - a ,Vagrant, ,virtual machine, that provides Laravel developers with all the tools necessary to develop Laravel straight out of the box, including, ,Ubuntu,, ,Gulp,, Bower and other development tools that are useful in developing full scale web applications.,[38],
,Canvas, - a Laravel-powered publishing platform that helps visualize monthly trends, see where readers are coming from and what time of day they prefer to read content. Features like: Publication Statistics, Distraction-free writing, ,Unsplash, Integration, Custom Social Data.,[39],
,Lazy Collection - This feature of the PHP framework Laravel 6, primarily enables you to deal with heavy loads of data, while keeping the memory usage low. Moreover, when you switch from all ( _ to cursor ( ), just one expressive model is moved within the memory at a time as cursor ( ) makes use of the LazyCollection instance.,
,First-party Packages,[,edit,],
,Ready-to-use packages provided by Laravel through Composer and Packagist include the following:
,
,Cashier,, introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides an interface for managing subscription billing services provided by ,Stripe,, such as handling ,coupons, and generating ,invoices,.,[40],
,Envoy,, introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides a clean, minimal syntax for defining common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using Blade style syntax, you can easily setup tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more.,[41],
,Socialite,, provides simplified mechanisms for authentication with different ,OAuth, providers, including ,Facebook,, ,Twitter,, ,Google,, ,GitHub, and ,Bitbucket,.,[42],
,Passport,, introduced in Laravel 5.3, provides a full ,OAuth2, server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter.,[43],
,Scout,, introduced in Laravel 5.3, provides a simple, driver based solution for adding full-text search to your Eloquent models.,[44],
,Dusk,, introduced in Laravel 5.4, provides an expressive, easy-to-use browser automation and testing API.,[45],
,Horizon,, introduced in Laravel 5.5, provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Laravel powered ,Redis, queues.,[46],
,Telescope,, introduced in Laravel 5.7, provides insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps and more.,[47],
,Sanctum,, introduced in Laravel 7.0, provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs (single page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token based APIs.,[48],. Firstly called Laravel Airlock, it has been renamed due to a trademark dispute regarding the name ‘Airlock.',[49],
,Artisan CLI,[,edit,],
,Laravel's ,command-line interface, (CLI), called ,Artisan,, was initially introduced in Laravel 3 with a limited set of capabilities.  Laravel's later migration to a Composer-based architecture allowed Artisan to incorporate different components from the ,Symfony, framework, resulting in the availability of additional Artisan features in Laravel 4.,[9],:,73–83,[50],
,The features of Artisan are mapped to different subcommands of the ,Artisan, command-line utility, providing functionality that aids in managing and building Laravel-based applications.  Common uses of Artisan include managing database migrations and seeding, publishing package assets, and generating ,boilerplate code, for new controllers and migrations; the latter frees the developer from creating proper code ,skeletons,.  The functionality and capabilities of Artisan can also be expanded by implementing new custom commands, which, for example, may be used to automate application-specific recurring tasks.,[9],:,73–83,[50],
,
,Conferences,[,edit,],
,  ,Taylor Otwell at the 2013 US Laracon,
,Laracon, is the official Laravel conference centered around the Laravel framework, covering its development, uses, and related general ,software development, topics. Laracon has taken place in the ,United States,, ,Europe, and online in the past.,[51],[52], Typically, the conference happens in the ,United States, and ,Europe, every year. 2017 was the first year a Laracon was held as an online event only. 2018 was the first year a Laracon was held in Australia. Each year the conference has a different variety of sponsors and organizers, but Laravel, Laravel News and UserScape are usually the primary organizers.

,Vim, (,/,v,ɪ,m,/,;,[2], a contraction of ,Vi IMproved,) is a clone, with additions, of ,Bill Joy,'s ,vi, ,text editor, program for Unix. Vim's author, ,Bram Moolenaar,, based it upon the ,source code, for a port of the ,Stevie editor, to the ,Amiga,[3], and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a ,command-line interface, and as a standalone application in a ,graphical user interface,. Vim is ,free and open-source software, and is released under a license that includes some ,charityware, clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in ,Uganda,.,[4], The license is compatible with the ,GNU General Public License, through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies ""under the ,GNU, GPL version 2 or any later version"".,[5],
,Since its release for the Amiga, ,cross-platform, development has made it available on ,many other systems,. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst ,Linux Journal, readers;,[6], in 2015 the ,Stack Overflow, developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor,,[7], and the fifth most popular development environment in 2019.,[8],

,History,[,edit,],
,Vim's forerunner, ,Stevie (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts),, was created by Tim Thompson for the ,Atari ST, in 1987,[9],[10], and further developed by Tony Andrews,[9],[11], and G.R. (Fred) Walter.,[12],[13],
,Basing his work on Stevie, ,Bram Moolenaar, began working on Vim for the ,Amiga, computer in 1988, with the first public release (Vim v1.14) in 1991.,[14],[15],[,better source needed,],
,At the time of its first release, the name ""Vim"" was an acronym for ""Vi IMitation"", but this changed to ""'Vi IMproved"" late in 1993.,[16],

,
,Interface,[,edit,],
,  ,Graphical Vim (gVim) under ,GTK+ 2,.,
,  ,Code at the top (Go), opened files, registers (""clipboard manager"" and macros history),
,Like ,vi,, Vim's interface is not based on menus or icons but on commands given in a ,text user interface,; its ,GUI, mode, ,gVim,, adds menus and toolbars for commonly used commands but the full functionality is still expressed through its ,command line, mode. Vi (and by extension Vim) tends to allow a typist to keep their fingers on the ,home row,, which can be an advantage for a ,touch typist,.,[29],
,Vim has a built-in ,tutorial, for beginners called vimtutor. It's usually installed along with Vim, but it exists as a separate executable and can be run with a shell command.,[30], There is also the Vim ,Users' Manual, that details Vim's features and a ,FAQ,. This manual can be read from within Vim, or found online.,[31],[32],
,Vim also has a built-in help facility (using the ,:help, command) that allows users to query and navigate through commands and features.
,
,  ,Search (grep) inside Vim across files on disk, without plugins,
,Modes,[,edit,],
,Vim has 12 different editing modes, 6 of which are variants of the 6 basic modes.,[33], The basic modes are:
,
,Normal, mode -  used for editor commands. This is also the default mode, unless the ,insertmode, option is specified.,
,Visual, mode - similar to normal mode, but used to highlight areas of text. Normal commands are run on the highlighted area, which for an instance can be used to move or edit a selection.,
,Select, mode - works similarly to visual mode. However, if a printable character, carriage return, or newline (or line feed) is entered, Vim inserts the character, and starts insert mode.,[34],
,Insert, mode - similar to editing in most modern editors. In insert mode, buffers can be modified with the text inserted.,
,Command-line, or ,Cmdline, mode - supports a single line input at the bottom of the Vim window. Normal commands (beginning with ,:,), and some other specific letters corresponding to different actions (including pattern search and the filter command) activate this mode.,
,Ex, mode - similarly to Cmdline mode, it takes a single line input at the bottom of the window. However, in Cmdline mode, entering a command exits the mode when the command is executed. Entering a command in Ex mode doesn't cause the mode to change.,
,  ,Commands history below: we can edit every command and/or run it again,
,Customization,[,edit,],
,Vim is highly customizable and extensible, making it an attractive tool for users that demand a large amount of control and flexibility over their text editing environment.,[35], Text input is facilitated by a variety of features designed to increase keyboard efficiency. Users can execute complex commands with ""key mappings,"" which can be customized and extended. The ""recording"" feature allows for the creation of ,macros, to automate sequences of keystrokes and call internal or user-defined functions and mappings. Abbreviations, similar to macros and key mappings, facilitate the expansion of short strings of text into longer ones and can also be used to correct mistakes. Vim also features an ""easy"" mode for users looking for a simpler text editing solution.,[36],
,There are many ,plugins, available that will extend or add new functionality to Vim, such as ,linters,, ,integration with Git,, ,showing colors in CSS,. These complex scripts are usually written in Vim's internal scripting language, vimscript (also known as VimL),,[37], but can be written in some other languages as well.
,
,  ,Vim editing JavaScript, with installed plugin GitGutter: pluses at the left shows new lines (according to information from Git).,
,There are projects bundling together complex scripts and customizations and aimed at turning Vim into a tool for a specific task or adding a major flavour to its behaviour. Examples include ,Cream,, which makes Vim behave like a click-and-type editor, or VimOutliner, which provides a comfortable ,outliner, for users of Unix-like systems.
,
,Features and improvements over vi,[,edit,],
,Vim has a vi compatibility mode, but when that mode isn't used, Vim has many enhancements over vi.,[38], However, even in compatibility mode, Vim is not entirely compatible with vi as defined in the ,Single Unix Specification,[39], and ,POSIX, (e.g., Vim does not support vi's open mode, only visual mode). Vim has nevertheless been described as ""very much compatible with Vi"".,[40],
,
,  ,File manager inside vim,
,Some of Vim's enhancements include ,completion,, ,comparison, and ,merging, of files (known as vimdiff), a comprehensive integrated help system, extended ,regular expressions,, ,scripting languages, (both native and through alternative scripting interpreters such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, etc.) including support for ,plugins,, a ,graphical user interface, (known as gvim), limited ,integrated development environment,-like features, ,mouse, interaction (both with and without the GUI), ,folding,, editing of compressed or archived files in ,gzip,, ,bzip2,, ,zip,, and ,tar, format and files over network protocols such as ,SSH,, ,FTP,, and ,HTTP,, session state preservation, ,spell checking,, split (horizontal and vertical) and tabbed windows, ,Unicode, and other multi-language support, ,syntax highlighting,, trans-session command, search and cursor position ,histories,, multiple level and branching ,undo/redo, history which can persist across editing sessions, and visual mode.
,
,  ,:version command display compilation flags (supported features),
,Vim script,[,edit,],
,Vim script, (also called ,vimscript, or ,VimL,),[41], is the ,scripting language, built into Vim.,[42], Based on the ,ex, editor language of the original ,vi, editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and function definitions. Since version 7, Vim script also supports more advanced data types such as ,lists, and ,dictionaries, and (a simple form of) ,object-oriented programming,. Built-in functions such as ,map(), and ,filter(), allow a basic form of ,functional programming,, and Vim script has ,lambda, since version 8.0. Vim script is mostly written in an ,imperative programming style,.
,Vim ,macros, can contain a sequence of ,normal-mode, commands, but can also invoke ex commands or functions written in Vim script for more complex tasks. Almost all extensions (called plugins or more commonly scripts) of the core Vim functionality are written in Vim script, but plugins can also utilize other languages like ,Perl,[43],, ,Python,[44],, ,Lua,[45],, ,Ruby,[46],, ,Tcl,[47],,  or ,Racket,.,[48], These plugins can be installed manually, or through a plugin manager such as Vundle, Pathogen, or Vim-Plug.
,Vim script files are stored as plain text, similarly to other code, and the filename extension is usually ,.vim,. One notable exception to that is Vim's config file, ,.vimrc,.
,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,"" This is the Hello World program in Vim script.,
echo ,""Hello, world!"",

,"" This is a simple while loop in Vim script.,
,let, ,i, ,=, ,1,
,while, ,i, ,<, ,5,
  echo ,""count is"", ,i,
  ,let, ,i, ,+=, ,1,
,endwhile,
unlet ,i,
,
,Availability,[,edit,],
,Whereas ,vi, was originally available only on ,Unix, operating systems, Vim has been ,ported, to many operating systems including ,AmigaOS, (the initial target platform), ,Atari, ,MiNT,, ,BeOS,, ,DOS,, ,Windows, starting from ,Windows NT 3.1,, ,OS/2,, ,OS/390,, ,MorphOS,, ,OpenVMS,, ,QNX,, ,RISC OS,, ,Linux,, ,BSD,, and ,Classic Mac OS,.,[49],  Also, Vim is shipped with every copy of ,Apple, ,macOS,.,[50],
,Independent ports of Vim are available both for ,Android,[51],[52], and ,iOS,.,[53],
,
,Neovim,[,edit,],
,  ,Neovim,
,  ,Screenshot of Neovim,
,Neovim,[54], is a fork – with additions,[55], – of Vim that strives to improve the extensibility and maintainability of Vim.,[56], Neovim shares the same configuration syntax with Vim; as a result, the same ,configuration file, can be used with both editors.,[57], If the added features of Neovim are not used, Neovim is compatible with almost all of Vim's features.,[58],
The Neovim project was started in 2014, with some Vim community members offering early support of the high-level refactoring effort to provide better scripting, plugins, and integration with modern ,GUIs,.,[59],[60],  The project is ,open source, and the full code is available on ,GitHub,.,[61],  Neovim had a successful fundraiser on March 23, 2014,,[62], supporting at least one full-time developer. Several frontends are under development, making use of Neovim's capabilities.,[63],[64],[65],
,The Neovim editor is available in Ubuntu's PPAs,,[66], and several other package managers,,[67], making it possible to install on a variety of operating systems.

,Yukihiro Matsumoto, (,まつもとゆきひろ,, ,Matsumoto Yukihiro,, born 14 April 1965),, also known as ,Matz,, is a Japanese computer scientist and ,software programmer, best known as the chief designer of the ,Ruby, ,programming language, and its reference implementation, ,Matz's Ruby Interpreter, (MRI). His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: ""Matz is nice and so we are nice,"" commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.
,As of 2011,[update],, Matsumoto is the Chief Architect of Ruby at ,Heroku,, an online cloud ,platform-as-a-service, in San Francisco. He is a fellow of ,Rakuten Institute of Technology,, a research and development organisation in ,Rakuten, Inc. He was appointed to the role of technical advisor for VASILY, Inc. starting in June 2014.,[1],

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Born in ,Osaka Prefecture,, Japan, he was raised in ,Tottori Prefecture, from the age of four. According to an interview conducted by ,Japan Inc.,, he was a self-taught programmer until the end of high school.,[2], He graduated with an information science degree from ,University of Tsukuba,, where he was a member of ,Ikuo Nakata,'s research lab on programming languages and ,compilers,.
,
,Work,[,edit,],
,He works for the Japanese open source company, netlab.jp. Matsumoto is known as one of the open source evangelists in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the ,Emacs,-based mail user agent, written entirely in ,Emacs Lisp,. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside Japan.,[3],
,
,Ruby,[,edit,],
,Matsumoto released the first version of the ,Ruby programming language, on 21 December 1995.,[4],[5], He still leads the development of the language's reference implementation, ,MRI, (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).
,
,MRuby,[,edit,],
,In April 2012, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called ,mruby,.,[6],[7], It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, called ritevm, and is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimised.
,
,streem,[,edit,],
,In December 2014, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new ,scripting language, called ,streem,, a ,concurrent, language based on a programming model similar to ,shell,, with influences from Ruby, ,Erlang, and other ,functional programming, languages.,[8],
,
,Treasure Data,[,edit,],
,Matsumoto has been listed as an investor for Treasure Data; many of the company's programs such as ,Fluentd, use Ruby as their primary language.,[9],[,failed verification,],

,WordPress, (,WordPress.org,) is a ,free and open-source, ,content management system, (CMS) written in ,PHP,[4], and paired with a ,MySQL, or ,MariaDB, database. Features include a ,plugin architecture, and a ,template system,, referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally created as a ,blog-publishing system, but has evolved to support other types of web content including more traditional ,mailing lists, and ,forums,, media galleries, membership sites, ,learning management systems, (LMS) and ,online stores,. WordPress is used by more than 60 million websites,,[5], including 33.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2019,[update],,,[6],[7], WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions in use.,[8], WordPress has also been used for other application domains such as ,pervasive display systems, (PDS).,[9],
,WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, American developer ,Matt Mullenweg,[1], and English developer ,Mike Little,,,[10],[11], as a ,fork, of ,b2/cafelog,. The software is released under the ,GPLv2, (or later) license.,[12],
,To function, WordPress has to be installed on a ,web server,, either part of an ,Internet hosting service, like ,WordPress.com, or a computer running the software package WordPress.org in order to serve as a ,network host, in its own right.,[13], A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes.

,Overview,[,edit,],
,""WordPress is a factory that makes webpages"",[14], is a core analogy designed to clarify the functions of WordPress: it stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.
,WordPress has a ,web template system, using a ,template processor,. Its architecture is a ,front controller,, routing all requests for non-static ,URI,s to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable ,permalinks,.,[15],
,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,WordPress users may install and switch among different ,themes,. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed  using WordPress standards with structured ,PHP,, valid ,HTML, (HyperText Markup Language), and ,Cascading Style Sheets, (CSS). Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress ""Appearance"" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via ,FTP,.,[16], The ,PHP,, ,HTML, and ,CSS, found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a ""child"" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.,[17], WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.,[18],
,
,Plugins,[,edit,],
,WordPress' ,plugin, architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available,,[19], each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.  However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from ,search engine optimization (SEO),, to ,client portals, used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of ,widgets, and ,navigation bars,. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via ,FTP, or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.
,Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.
,
,Mobile applications,[,edit,],
,Phone apps for WordPress exist for ,WebOS,,,[20], ,Android,,,[21], ,iOS, (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),,[22],[23], ,Windows Phone,, and ,BlackBerry,.,[24], These applications, designed by ,Automattic,, have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.,[22],[23],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,The ,WordPress Accessibility Team, has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.,[25], The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design. The WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards state that ""All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA."",[26],
,
,Other features,[,edit,],
,WordPress also features integrated link management; a ,search engine,–friendly, clean ,permalink, structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for ,tagging, of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to ,smart quotes,). WordPress also supports the ,Trackback, and ,Pingback, standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.
,
,Multi-user and multi-blogging,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.
,As of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.,[27],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,b2/cafelog,, more commonly known as ,b2, or ,cafelog,, was the precursor to WordPress.,[28], b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003.,[29], It was written in PHP for use with ,MySQL, by Michel Valdrighi, who is now a contributing developer to WordPress. Although WordPress is the official successor, another project, ,b2evolution,, is also in active development.
,WordPress first appeared in 2003 as a joint effort between ,Matt Mullenweg, and ,Mike Little, to create a ,fork, of b2.,[30], Christine Selleck Tremoulet, a friend of Mullenweg, suggested the name ,WordPress,.,[31],[32],
,In 2004 the licensing terms for the competing ,Movable Type, package were changed by ,Six Apart,, resulting in many of its most influential users migrating to WordPress.,[33],[34], By October 2009 the Open Source CMS MarketShare Report concluded that WordPress enjoyed the greatest brand strength of any open-source content management system.
,As of June 2019, WordPress is used by 60.8% of all the websites whose content management system is known. This is 27.5% of the top 10 million websites.,[6],[35],
,
,Awards and recognition,[,edit,],

,
,WordPress 5.0 ""Bebo"",[,edit,],
,The December 2018 release of WordPress 5.0, ""Bebo"", is named in homage to the pioneering Cuban jazz musician ,Bebo Valdés,.,[87],
,
,  , ,  ,
,It included a new default editor ""Gutenberg"" – a block-based editor; it allows users to modify their displayed content in a much more user friendly way than prior iterations. Blocks are abstract units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a ,web page,.,[88], Past content that was created on WordPress pages is listed under what is referred to as a Classic Block.,[89], Prior to Gutenberg, there were several block-based editors available as WordPress plugins, e.g. ,Elementor,, and following the release of Gutenberg it was compared to existing plugins.,[90],[91],
,
,Classic Editor plugin,[,edit,],
,The Classic Editor Plugin was created as result of User preferences and as a way to help website developers to maintain past plugins only compatible with WordPress 4.9.8 giving plugin developers time to get their plugins updated & compatible with the 5.0 release. Having the Classic Editor plugin installed restores the ""classic"" editing experience that WordPress has had up until the WordPress 5.0 release.,[92], The Classic Editor Plugin will be supported at least until 2022.,[93],
,The Classic Editor plugin is active on over 5,000,000 installations of WordPress.,[94],
,
,Future,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(,February 2020,),
,Matt Mullenweg has stated that the future of WordPress is in social, mobile, and as an application platform.,[95],[96],
,
,Vulnerabilities,[,edit,],
,Many security issues,[97], have been uncovered in the software, particularly in 2007, 2008, and 2015. According to ,Secunia,, WordPress in April 2009 had seven unpatched security advisories (out of 32 total), with a maximum rating of ""Less Critical"". Secunia maintains an up-to-date list of WordPress vulnerabilities.,[98],
,In January 2007, many high-profile ,search engine optimization, (SEO) blogs, as well as many low-profile commercial blogs featuring ,AdSense,, were targeted and attacked with a WordPress exploit.,[99], A separate vulnerability on one of the project site's ,web servers, allowed an attacker to introduce exploitable code in the form of a ,back door, to some downloads of WordPress 2.1.1. The 2.1.2 release addressed this issue; an advisory released at the time advised all users to upgrade immediately.,[100],
,In May 2007, a study revealed that 98% of WordPress blogs being run were exploitable because they were running outdated and unsupported versions of the software.,[101], In part to mitigate this problem, WordPress made updating the software a much easier, ""one click"" automated process in version 2.7 (released in December 2008).,[102], However, the filesystem security settings required to enable the update process can be an additional risk.,[103],
,In a June 2007 interview, Stefan Esser, the founder of the PHP Security Response Team, spoke critically of WordPress' security track record, citing problems with the application's architecture that made it unnecessarily difficult to write code that is secure from ,SQL injection, vulnerabilities, as well as some other problems.,[104],
,In June 2013, it was found that some of the 50 most downloaded WordPress plugins were vulnerable to common Web attacks such as SQL injection and ,XSS,. A separate inspection of the top-10 e-commerce plugins showed that seven of them were vulnerable.,[105],
,In an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall, automatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7.,[106],
,Individual installations of WordPress can be protected with security plugins that prevent user enumeration, hide resources and thwart probes. Users can also protect their WordPress installations by taking steps such as keeping all WordPress installation, themes, and plugins updated, using only trusted themes and plugins,,[107], editing the site's ,.htaccess, configuration file if supported by the web server to prevent many types of SQL injection attacks and block unauthorized access to sensitive files. It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be ,hackers, can easily list all the plugins a site uses, and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their own files (such as a ,web shell,) that collect sensitive information.
,Developers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as a ,CSRF,, ,LFI,, ,RFI,, ,XSS,, SQL injection and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes and other add-ins from other developers.
,In March 2015, it was reported by many security experts and SEOs, including Search Engine Land, that a ,SEO, plugin for WordPress called ,Yoast, which is used by more than 14 million users worldwide has a vulnerability which can lead to an exploit where hackers can do a Blind SQL injection.,[108],[109], To fix that issue they immediately introduced a newer version 1.7.4 of the same plugin to avoid any disturbance on web because of the security lapse that the plugin had.,[110],
,In January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress ,REST API, that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater. The auditors quietly notified WordPress developers, and within six days WordPress released a high priority patch to version 4.7.2 which addressed the problem.,[111],[112],
,
,  ,The ,canvas fingerprinting, warning that is typically given by ,Tor Browser, for WordPress-based websites.,
,As of WordPress 5.2, the minimum PHP version requirement is PHP 5.6,,[113], which was released on August 28, 2014,,[114], and which has been unsupported by the PHP Group and not received any security patches since December 31, 2018.,[114], Thus, WordPress recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater.,[113],
,In the absence of specific alterations to their default formatting code, WordPress-based websites use the ,canvas element, to detect whether the browser is able to correctly render ,emoji,. Because ,Tor Browser, does not currently discriminate between this legitimate use of the ,Canvas, ,API, and an effort to perform ,canvas fingerprinting,, it warns that the website is attempting to 'extract HTML5 canvas image data'. Ongoing efforts seek workarounds to reassure privacy advocates while retaining the ability to check for proper emoji rendering capability.,[115],
,
,Development and support,[,edit,],
,Key developers,[,edit,],
,Matt Mullenweg, and ,Mike Little, were co-founders of the project. The core lead developers include Helen Hou-Sandí, Dion Hulse, Mark Jaquith, Matt Mullenweg, Andrew Ozz, and Andrew Nacin.,[116],[117],
,WordPress is also developed by its community, including ,WP testers,, a group of volunteers who test each release. They have early access to ,nightly builds,, beta versions and release candidates. Errors are documented in a special ,mailing list, or the project's ,Trac, tool.
,Though largely developed by the community surrounding it, WordPress is closely associated with ,Automattic,, the company founded by Matt Mullenweg.,[118], On September 9, 2010, Automattic handed the WordPress trademark to the newly created WordPress Foundation, which is an umbrella organization supporting WordPress.org (including the software and archives for plugins and themes), ,bbPress, and ,BuddyPress,.
,
,WordCamp developer and user conferences,[,edit,],
,  ,A WordCamp in ,Sofia,, ,Bulgaria, (2011),
,WordCamps are casual, locally organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress.,[119], The first such event was WordCamp 2006 in August 2006 in ,San Francisco,, which lasted one day and had over 500 attendees.,[120],[121], The first WordCamp outside San Francisco was held in ,Beijing, in September 2007.,[122], Since then, there have been over 1,022 WordCamps in over 75 cities in 65 different countries around the world.,[119], WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was the last official annual conference of WordPress developers and users taking place in San Francisco, having now been replaced with WordCamp US.,[123], First ran in 2013 as WordCamp Europe, regional WordCamps in other geographical regions are held with the aim of connecting people who aren't already active in their local communities and inspire attendees to start user communities in their hometowns.,[124], In 2019, the ,Nordic region, had its own WordCamp Nordic.,[125],[126], The first WordCamp ,Asia, was to be held in 2020,,[127], but cancelled due to the ,COVID-19 pandemic,.,[128],
,
,Support,[,edit,],
,WordPress' primary support website is WordPress.org. This support website hosts both WordPress Codex, the online manual for WordPress and a living repository for WordPress information and documentation,,[129],
and WordPress Forums, an active online community of WordPress users.,[130],

,Scala, (,/,ˈ,s,k,ɑː,l,ɑː,/, ,SKAH,-lah,),[7], is a ,general-purpose, ,programming language, providing support for ,functional programming, and a strong ,static, ,type system,. Designed to be concise,,[8], many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address ,criticisms of Java,.,[6],
,Scala source code is intended to be compiled to ,Java bytecode,, so that the resulting executable code runs on a ,Java virtual machine,. Scala provides ,language interoperability, with ,Java,, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code.,[9], Like Java, Scala is ,object-oriented,, and uses a ,curly-brace syntax, reminiscent of the ,C programming language,. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of ,functional programming, languages like ,Scheme,, ,Standard ML, and ,Haskell,, including ,currying,, ,immutability,, ,lazy evaluation,, and ,pattern matching,. It also has an advanced type system supporting ,algebraic data types,, ,covariance and contravariance,, ,higher-order types, (but not ,higher-rank types,), and ,anonymous types,. Other features of Scala not present in Java include ,operator overloading,, optional parameters, ,named parameters,, and ,raw strings,. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is ,checked exceptions,, which has proved controversial.,[10],
,The name Scala is a portmanteau of ,scalable, and ,language,, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.,[11],

,History,[,edit,],
,The design of Scala started in 2001 at the ,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, (EPFL) (in ,Lausanne,, ,Switzerland,) by ,Martin Odersky,. It followed on from work on Funnel, a programming language combining ideas from functional programming and ,Petri nets,.,[12], Odersky formerly worked on ,Generic Java,, and ,javac,, Sun's Java compiler.,[12],
,After an internal release in late 2003, Scala was released publicly in early 2004 on the ,Java platform,,,[13],[6],[12],[14], A second version (v2.0) followed in March 2006.,[6],
,On 17 January 2011, the Scala team won a five-year research grant of over €2.3 million from the ,European Research Council,.,[15], On 12 May 2011, Odersky and collaborators launched Typesafe Inc. (later renamed ,Lightbend Inc.,), a company to provide commercial support, training, and services for Scala. Typesafe received a $3 million investment in 2011 from ,Greylock Partners,.,[16],[17],[18],[19],
,
,Platforms and license,[,edit,],
,Scala runs on the ,Java platform, (,Java virtual machine,) and is compatible with existing ,Java, programs.,[13], As ,Android, applications are typically written in Java and translated from Java bytecode into ,Dalvik, bytecode (which may be further translated to native machine code during installation) when packaged, Scala's Java compatibility makes it well-suited to Android development, more so when a functional approach is preferred.,[20],
,The reference Scala software distribution, including compiler and libraries, is released under the ,Apache license,.,[21],
,
,Other compilers and targets,[,edit,],
,Scala.js, is a Scala compiler that compiles to JavaScript, making it possible to write Scala programs that can run in web browsers or ,Node.js,.,[22], The compiler was in development since 2013, was announced as no longer experimental in 2015 (v0.6). Version v1.0.0-M1 was released in June 2018, but in 2019 was still as M7.,[23],
,Scala Native is a Scala ,compiler, that targets the ,LLVM, compiler infrastructure to create executable code that uses a lightweight managed runtime, which uses the ,Boehm garbage collector,. The project is led by Denys Shabalin and had its first release, 0.1, on 14 March 2017. Development of Scala Native began in 2015 with a goal of being faster than ,just-in-time compilation, for the JVM by eliminating the initial runtime compilation of code and also providing the ability to call native routines directly.,[24],[25],
,A reference Scala compiler targeting the ,.NET Framework, and its ,Common Language Runtime, was released in June 2004,,[12], but was officially dropped in 2012.,[26],
,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,""Hello World"" example,[,edit,],
,The ,Hello World program, written in Scala has this form:
,
, ,object, ,HelloWorld, ,extends, ,App, ,{,
   ,println,(,""Hello, World!"",),
 ,},
,
,Unlike the ,stand-alone Hello World application for Java,, there is no class declaration and nothing is declared to be static; a ,singleton object, created with the ,object, keyword is used instead.
,When the program is stored in file ,HelloWorld.scala,, the user compiles it with the command:
,
,$ scalac HelloWorld.scala
,
,and runs it with
,
,$ scala HelloWorld
,
,This is analogous to the process for compiling and running Java code. Indeed, Scala's compiling and executing model is identical to that of Java, making it compatible with Java build tools such as ,Apache Ant,.
,A shorter version of the ""Hello World"" Scala program is:
,
,println,(,""Hello, World!"",),
,
,Scala includes interactive shell and scripting support.,[27], Saved in a file named ,HelloWorld2.scala,, this can be run as a script with no prior compiling using:
,
,$ scala HelloWorld2.scala
,
,Commands can also be entered directly into the Scala interpreter, using the option ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},-e,:
,
,$ scala ,-e, 'println(""Hello, World!"")'
,
,Expressions can be entered interactively in the ,REPL,:
,
,$, scala

,scala> List(1, 2, 3).map(x => x * x),
,res0: List[Int] = List(1, 4, 9),

,scala>,
,
,Basic example,[,edit,],
,The following example shows the differences between Java and Scala syntax:
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,int, ,mathFunction,(,int, ,num,), ,{,
    ,int, ,numSquare, ,=, ,num,*,num,;,
    ,return, ,(,int,), ,(,Math,.,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+,
      ,Math,.,log,(,numSquare,));,
,},
,
,
,
,// Scala: Direct conversion from Java,

,// no import needed; scala.math,
,// already imported as `math`,
,def, ,mathFunction,(,num,:, ,Int,),:, ,Int, ,=, ,{,
  ,var, ,numSquare,:, ,Int, ,=, ,num,*,num,
  ,return, ,(,math,.,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+, ,math,.,log,(,numSquare,)).,
    ,asInstanceOf,[,Int,],
,},
,
,
,// Scala: More idiomatic,
,// Uses type inference, omits `return` statement,,
,// uses `toInt` method, declares numSquare immutable,

,import, ,math._,
,def, ,mathFunction,(,num,:, ,Int,), ,=, ,{,
  ,val, ,numSquare, ,=, ,num,*,num,
  ,(,cbrt,(,numSquare,), ,+, ,log,(,numSquare,)).,toInt,
,},
,
,
,Some syntactic differences in this code are:
,
,Scala does not require semicolons to end statements.,
,Value types are capitalized: ,Int, Double, Boolean, instead of ,int, double, boolean,.,
,Parameter and return types follow, as in ,Pascal,, rather than precede as in ,C,.,
,Methods must be preceded by ,def,.,
,Local or class variables must be preceded by ,val, (indicates an ,immutable, variable) or ,var, (indicates a ,mutable, variable).,
,The ,return, operator is unnecessary in a function (although allowed); the value of the last executed statement or expression is normally the function's value.,
,Instead of the Java cast operator ,(Type) foo,, Scala uses ,foo.asInstanceOf[Type],, or a specialized function such as ,toDouble, or ,toInt,.,
,Instead of Java's ,import foo.*;,, Scala uses ,import foo._,.,
,Function or method ,foo(), can also be called as just ,foo,; method ,thread.send(signo), can also be called as just ,thread send signo,; and method ,foo.toString(), can also be called as just ,foo toString,.,
,These syntactic relaxations are designed to allow support for ,domain-specific languages,.
,Some other basic syntactic differences:
,
,Array references are written like function calls, e.g. ,array(i), rather than ,array[i],. (Internally in Scala, the former expands into array.apply(i) which returns the reference),
,Generic types are written as e.g. ,List[String], rather than Java's ,List<String>,.,
,Instead of the pseudo-type ,void,, Scala has the actual ,singleton class, ,Unit, (see below).,
,Example with classes,[,edit,],
,The following example contrasts the definition of classes in Java and Scala.
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,public, ,class, ,Point, ,{,
  ,private, ,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,y,;,

  ,public, ,Point,(,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,final, ,double, ,y,), ,{,
    ,this,.,x, ,=, ,x,;,
    ,this,.,y, ,=, ,y,;,
  ,},

  ,public, ,Point,(,
    ,final, ,double, ,x,,, ,final, ,double, ,y,,,
    ,final, ,boolean, ,addToGrid,
  ,), ,{,
    ,this,(,x,,, ,y,);,

    ,if, ,(,addToGrid,),
      ,grid,.,add,(,this,);,
  ,},

  ,public, ,Point,(), ,{,
    ,this,(,0.0,,, ,0.0,);,
  ,},

  ,public, ,double, ,getX,(), ,{,
    ,return, ,x,;,
  ,},

  ,public, ,double, ,getY,(), ,{,
    ,return, ,y,;,
  ,},

  ,double, ,distanceToPoint,(,final, ,Point, ,other,), ,{,
    ,return, ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x,,, ,y,,,
      ,other,.,x,,, ,other,.,y,);,
  ,},

  ,private, ,static, ,Grid, ,grid, ,=, ,new, ,Grid,();,

  ,static, ,double, ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,
      ,final, ,double, ,x1,,, ,final, ,double, ,y1,,,
      ,final, ,double, ,x2,,, ,final, ,double, ,y2,
  ,), ,{,
    ,return, ,Math,.,hypot,(,x1, ,-, ,x2,,, ,y1, ,-, ,y2,);,
  ,},
,},
,
,
,// Scala,
,class, ,Point,(,
    ,val, ,x,:, ,Double,,, ,val, ,y,:, ,Double,,,
    ,addToGrid,:, ,Boolean, ,=, ,false,
,), ,{,
  ,import, ,Point._,

  ,if, ,(,addToGrid,),
    ,grid,.,add,(,this,),

  ,def, ,this,(), ,=, ,this,(,0.0,,, ,0.0,),

  ,def, ,distanceToPoint,(,other,:, ,Point,), ,=,
    ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x,,, ,y,,, ,other,.,x,,, ,other,.,y,),
,},

,object, ,Point, ,{,
  ,private, ,val, ,grid, ,=, ,new, ,Grid,(),

  ,def, ,distanceBetweenPoints,(,x1,:, ,Double,,, ,y1,:, ,Double,,,
      ,x2,:, ,Double,,, ,y2,:, ,Double,), ,=, ,{,
    ,math,.,hypot,(,x1, ,-, ,x2,,, ,y1, ,-, ,y2,),
  ,},
,},
,
,
,The code above shows some of the conceptual differences between Java and Scala's handling of classes:
,
,Scala has no static variables or methods. Instead, it has ,singleton objects,, which are essentially classes with only one instance. Singleton objects are declared using ,object, instead of ,class,. It is common to place static variables and methods in a singleton object with the same name as the class name, which is then known as a ,companion object,.,[13], (The underlying class for the singleton object has a ,$, appended. Hence, for ,class Foo, with companion object ,object Foo,, under the hood there's a class ,Foo$, containing the companion object's code, and one object of this class is created, using the ,singleton pattern,.),
,In place of constructor parameters, Scala has ,class parameters,, which are placed on the class, similar to parameters to a function. When declared with a ,val, or ,var, modifier, fields are also defined with the same name, and automatically initialized from the class parameters. (Under the hood, external access to public fields always goes through accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods, which are automatically created. The accessor function has the same name as the field, which is why it's unnecessary in the above example to explicitly declare accessor methods.) Note that alternative constructors can also be declared, as in Java. Code that would go into the default constructor (other than initializing the member variables) goes directly at class level.,
,Default visibility in Scala is ,public,.,
,Features (with reference to Java),[,edit,],
,Scala has the same compiling model as ,Java, and ,C#,, namely separate compiling and ,dynamic class loading,, so that Scala code can call Java libraries.
,Scala's operational characteristics are the same as Java's. The Scala compiler generates byte code that is nearly identical to that generated by the Java compiler.,[13], In fact, Scala code can be ,decompiled, to readable Java code, with the exception of certain constructor operations. To the ,Java virtual machine, (JVM), Scala code and Java code are indistinguishable. The only difference is one extra runtime library, ,scala-library.jar,.,[28],
,Scala adds a large number of features compared with Java, and has some fundamental differences in its underlying model of expressions and types, which make the language theoretically cleaner and eliminate several ,corner cases, in Java. From the Scala perspective, this is practically important because several added features in Scala are also available in C#. Examples include:
,
,Syntactic flexibility,[,edit,],
,As mentioned above, Scala has a good deal of syntactic flexibility, compared with Java. The following are some examples:
,
,Semicolons are unnecessary; lines are automatically joined if they begin or end with a token that cannot normally come in this position, or if there are unclosed parentheses or brackets.,
,Any method can be used as an infix operator, e.g. ,""%d apples"".format(num), and ,""%d apples"" format num, are equivalent. In fact, arithmetic operators like ,+, and ,<<, are treated just like any other methods, since function names are allowed to consist of sequences of arbitrary symbols (with a few exceptions made for things like parens, brackets and braces that must be handled specially); the only special treatment that such symbol-named methods undergo concerns the handling of precedence.,
,Methods ,apply, and ,update, have syntactic short forms. ,foo(),—where ,foo, is a value (singleton object or class instance)—is short for ,foo.apply(),, and ,foo() = 42, is short for ,foo.update(42),. Similarly, ,foo(42), is short for ,foo.apply(42),, and ,foo(4) = 2, is short for ,foo.update(4, 2),. This is used for collection classes and extends to many other cases, such as ,STM, cells.,
,Scala distinguishes between no-parens (,def foo = 42,) and empty-parens (,def foo() = 42,) methods. When calling an empty-parens method, the parentheses may be omitted, which is useful when calling into Java libraries that do not know this distinction, e.g., using ,foo.toString, instead of ,foo.toString(),. By convention, a method should be defined with empty-parens when it performs ,side effects,.,
,Method names ending in colon (,:,) expect the argument on the left-hand-side and the receiver on the right-hand-side. For example, the ,4 :: 2 :: Nil, is the same as ,Nil.::(2).::(4),, the first form corresponding visually to the result (a list with first element 4 and second element 2).,
,Class body variables can be transparently implemented as separate getter and setter methods. For ,trait FooLike { var bar: Int },, an implementation may be ,object, ,Foo, ,extends, ,FooLike, ,{, ,private, ,var, ,x, ,=, ,0,;, ,def, ,bar, ,=, ,x,;, ,def, ,bar_=,(,value,:, ,Int,), ,{, ,x, ,=, ,value, ,}}, ,}, ,},. The call site will still be able to use a concise ,foo.bar = 42,.,
,The use of curly braces instead of parentheses is allowed in method calls. This allows pure library implementations of new control structures.,[29], For example, ,breakable { ... if (...) break() ... }, looks as if ,breakable, was a language defined keyword, but really is just a method taking a ,thunk, argument. Methods that take thunks or functions often place these in a second parameter list, allowing to mix parentheses and curly braces syntax: ,Vector.fill(4) { math.random }, is the same as ,Vector.fill(4)(math.random),. The curly braces variant allows the expression to span multiple lines.,
,For-expressions (explained further down) can accommodate any type that defines monadic methods such as ,map,, ,flatMap, and ,filter,.,
,By themselves, these may seem like questionable choices, but collectively they serve the purpose of allowing ,domain-specific languages, to be defined in Scala without needing to extend the compiler. For example, ,Erlang,'s special syntax for sending a message to an actor, i.e. ,actor ! message, can be (and is) implemented in a Scala library without needing language extensions.
,
,Unified type system,[,edit,],
,Java makes a sharp distinction between primitive types (e.g. ,int, and ,boolean,) and reference types (any ,class,). Only reference types are part of the inheritance scheme, deriving from ,java.lang.Object,. In Scala, all types inherit from a top-level class ,Any,, whose immediate children are ,AnyVal, (value types, such as ,Int, and ,Boolean,) and ,AnyRef, (reference types, as in Java). This means that the Java distinction between primitive types and boxed types (e.g. ,int, vs. ,Integer,) is not present in Scala; boxing and unboxing is completely transparent to the user. Scala 2.10 allows for new value types to be defined by the user.
,
,For-expressions,[,edit,],
,Instead of the Java "",foreach,"" loops for looping through an iterator, Scala has ,for,-expressions, which are similar to ,list comprehensions, in languages such as Haskell, or a combination of list comprehensions and ,generator expressions, in ,Python,. For-expressions using the ,yield, keyword allow a new ,collection, to be generated by iterating over an existing one, returning a new collection of the same type. They are translated by the compiler into a series of ,map,, ,flatMap, and ,filter, calls. Where ,yield, is not used, the code approximates to an imperative-style loop, by translating to ,foreach,.
,A simple example is:
,
,val, ,s, ,=, ,for, ,(,x, ,<-, ,1, ,to, ,25, ,if, ,x,*,x, ,>, ,50,), ,yield, ,2,*,x,
,
,The result of running it is the following vector:
,
,Vector(16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50),
,(Note that the expression ,1 to 25, is not special syntax. The method ,to, is rather defined in the standard Scala library as an extension method on integers, using a technique known as implicit conversions,[30], that allows new methods to be added to existing types.)
,A more complex example of iterating over a map is:
,
,// Given a map specifying Twitter users mentioned in a set of tweets,,
,// and number of times each user was mentioned, look up the users,
,// in a map of known politicians, and return a new map giving only the,
,// Democratic politicians (as objects, rather than strings).,
,val, ,dem_mentions, ,=, ,for, ,{,
    ,(,mention,,, ,times,), ,<-, ,mentions,
    ,account,          ,<-, ,accounts,.,get,(,mention,),
    ,if, ,account,.,party, ,==, ,""Democratic"",
  ,}, ,yield, ,(,account,,, ,times,),
,
,Expression ,(mention, times) <- mentions, is an example of ,pattern matching, (see below). Iterating over a map returns a set of key-value ,tuples,, and pattern-matching allows the tuples to easily be destructured into separate variables for the key and value. Similarly, the result of the comprehension also returns key-value tuples, which are automatically built back up into a map because the source object (from the variable ,mentions,) is a map. Note that if ,mentions, instead held a list, set, array or other collection of tuples, exactly the same code above would yield a new collection of the same type.
,
,Functional tendencies,[,edit,],
,While supporting all of the object-oriented features available in Java (and in fact, augmenting them in various ways), Scala also provides a large number of capabilities that are normally found only in ,functional programming, languages. Together, these features allow Scala programs to be written in an almost completely functional style and also allow functional and object-oriented styles to be mixed.
,Examples are:
,
,No distinction between statements and expressions,
,Type inference,
,Anonymous functions, with capturing semantics (i.e., ,closures,),

,Unlike C or Java, but similar to languages such as ,Lisp,, Scala makes no distinction between statements and expressions. All statements are in fact expressions that evaluate to some value. Functions that would be declared as returning ,void, in C or Java, and statements like ,while, that logically do not return a value, are in Scala considered to return the type ,Unit,, which is a ,singleton type,, with only one object of that type. Functions and operators that never return at all (e.g. the ,throw, operator or a function that always exits ,non-locally, using an exception) logically have return type ,Nothing,, a special type containing no objects; that is, a ,bottom type,, i.e. a subclass of every possible type. (This in turn makes type ,Nothing, compatible with every type, allowing ,type inference, to function correctly.)
,Similarly, an ,if-then-else, ""statement"" is actually an expression, which produces a value, i.e. the result of evaluating one of the two branches. This means that such a block of code can be inserted wherever an expression is desired, obviating the need for a ,ternary operator, in Scala:
,
,

,
,// Java:,
,int, ,hexDigit, ,=, ,x, ,>=, ,10, ,?, ,x, ,+, ,'A', ,-, ,10, ,:, ,x, ,+, ,'0',;,
,
,
,// Scala:,
,val, ,hexDigit, ,=, ,if, ,(,x, ,>=, ,10,), ,x, ,+, ,'A', ,-, ,10, ,else, ,x, ,+, ,'0',
,
,
,For similar reasons, ,return, statements are unnecessary in Scala, and in fact are discouraged. As in Lisp, the last expression in a block of code is the value of that block of code, and if the block of code is the body of a function, it will be returned by the function.
,To make it clear that all functions are expressions, even methods that return ,Unit, are written with an equals sign
,
,def, ,printValue,(,x,:, ,String,),:, ,Unit, ,=, ,{,
  ,println,(,""I ate a %s"",.,format,(,x,)),
,},
,
,or equivalently (with type inference, and omitting the unnecessary braces):
,
,def, ,printValue,(,x,:, ,String,), ,=, ,println,(,""I ate a %s"", ,format, ,x,),
,
,Type inference,[,edit,],
,Due to ,type inference,, the type of variables, function return values, and many other expressions can typically be omitted, as the compiler can deduce it. Examples are ,val x = ""foo"", (for an immutable ,constant, or ,immutable object,) or ,var x = 1.5, (for a variable whose value can later be changed). Type inference in Scala is essentially local, in contrast to the more global ,Hindley-Milner, algorithm used in ,Haskell,, ,ML, and other more purely functional languages. This is done to facilitate object-oriented programming. The result is that certain types still need to be declared (most notably, function parameters, and the return types of ,recursive functions,), e.g.
,
,def, ,formatApples,(,x,:, ,Int,), ,=, ,""I ate %d apples"",.,format,(,x,),
,
,or (with a return type declared for a recursive function)
,
,def, ,factorial,(,x,:, ,Int,),:, ,Int, ,=,
  ,if, ,(,x, ,==, ,0,),
    ,1,
  ,else,
    ,x,*,factorial,(,x, ,-, ,1,),
,
,Anonymous functions,[,edit,],
,In Scala, functions are objects, and a convenient syntax exists for specifying ,anonymous functions,. An example is the expression ,x => x < 2,, which specifies a function with one parameter, that compares its argument to see if it is less than 2. It is equivalent to the Lisp form ,(lambda (x) (< x 2)),. Note that neither the type of ,x, nor the return type need be explicitly specified, and can generally be inferred by ,type inference,; but they can be explicitly specified, e.g. as ,(x: Int) => x < 2, or even ,(x: Int) => (x < 2): Boolean,.
,Anonymous functions behave as true ,closures, in that they automatically capture any variables that are lexically available in the environment of the enclosing function. Those variables will be available even after the enclosing function returns, and unlike in the case of Java's ,anonymous inner classes, do not need to be declared as final. (It is even possible to modify such variables if they are mutable, and the modified value will be available the next time the anonymous function is called.)
,An even shorter form of anonymous function uses ,placeholder, variables: For example, the following:
,
,list map { x => sqrt(x) },
,can be written more concisely as
,
,list map { sqrt(_) },
,or even
,
,list map sqrt,
,Immutability,[,edit,],
,Scala enforces a distinction between immutable and mutable variables. Mutable variables are declared using the ,var, keyword and immutable values are declared using the ,val, keyword.
A variable declared using the ,val, keyword can not be reassigned in the same way that a variable declared using the ,final, keyword can't be reassigned in Java. It should be noted however that ,val,'s are only shallowly immutable, that is, an object referenced by a val is not guaranteed to itself be immutable.
,Immutable classes are encouraged by convention however, and the Scala standard library provides a rich set of immutable ,collection, classes.
Scala provides mutable and immutable variants of most collection classes, and the immutable version is always used unless the mutable version is explicitly imported.,[31],
The immutable variants are ,persistent data structures, that always return an updated copy of an old object instead of updating the old object destructively in place.
An example of this is ,immutable linked lists, where prepending an element to a list is done by returning a new list node consisting of the element and a reference to the list tail.
Appending an element to a list can only be done by prepending all elements in the old list to a new list with only the new element.
In the same way, inserting an element in the middle of a list will copy the first half of the list, but keep a reference to the second half of the list. This is called structural sharing.
This allows for very easy concurrency — no locks are needed as no shared objects are ever modified.,[32],
,
,Lazy (non-strict) evaluation,[,edit,],
,Evaluation is strict (""eager"") by default. In other words, Scala evaluates expressions as soon as they are available, rather than as needed. However, it is possible to declare a variable non-strict (""lazy"") with the ,lazy, keyword, meaning that the code to produce the variable's value will not be evaluated until the first time the variable is referenced. Non-strict collections of various types also exist (such as the type ,Stream,, a non-strict linked list), and any collection can be made non-strict with the ,view, method. Non-strict collections provide a good semantic fit to things like server-produced data, where the evaluation of the code to generate later elements of a list (that in turn triggers a request to a server, possibly located somewhere else on the web) only happens when the elements are actually needed.
,
,Tail recursion,[,edit,],
,Functional programming languages commonly provide ,tail call, optimization to allow for extensive use of ,recursion, without ,stack overflow, problems. Limitations in Java bytecode complicate tail call optimization on the JVM. In general, a function that calls itself with a tail call can be optimized, but mutually recursive functions cannot. ,Trampolines, have been suggested as a workaround.,[33], Trampoline support has been provided by the Scala library with the object ,scala.util.control.TailCalls, since Scala 2.8.0 (released 14 July 2010). A function may optionally be annotated with ,@tailrec,, in which case it will not compile unless it is tail recursive.,[34],
,
,Case classes and pattern matching,[,edit,],
,Scala has built-in support for ,pattern matching,, which can be thought of as a more sophisticated, extensible version of a ,switch statement,, where arbitrary data types can be matched (rather than just simple types like integers, booleans and strings), including arbitrary nesting. A special type of class known as a ,case class, is provided, which includes automatic support for pattern matching and can be used to model the ,algebraic data types, used in many functional programming languages. (From the perspective of Scala, a case class is simply a normal class for which the compiler automatically adds certain behaviors that could also be provided manually, e.g., definitions of methods providing for deep comparisons and hashing, and destructuring a case class on its constructor parameters during pattern matching.)
,An example of a definition of the ,quicksort, algorithm using pattern matching is this:
,
,def, ,qsort,(,list,:, ,List,[,Int,]),:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,list, ,match, ,{,
  ,case, ,Nil, ,=>, ,Nil,
  ,case, ,pivot, ,::, ,tail, ,=>,
    ,val, ,(,smaller,,, ,rest,), ,=, ,tail,.,partition,(,_, ,<, ,pivot,),
    ,qsort,(,smaller,), ,:::, ,pivot, ,::, ,qsort,(,rest,),
,},
,
,The idea here is that we partition a list into the elements less than a pivot and the elements not less, recursively sort each part, and paste the results together with the pivot in between. This uses the same ,divide-and-conquer, strategy of ,mergesort, and other fast sorting algorithms.
,The ,match, operator is used to do pattern matching on the object stored in ,list,. Each ,case, expression is tried in turn to see if it will match, and the first match determines the result. In this case, ,Nil, only matches the literal object ,Nil,, but ,pivot :: tail, matches a non-empty list, and simultaneously ,destructures, the list according to the pattern given. In this case, the associated code will have access to a local variable named ,pivot, holding the head of the list, and another variable ,tail, holding the tail of the list. Note that these variables are read-only, and are semantically very similar to variable ,bindings, established using the ,let, operator in Lisp and Scheme.
,Pattern matching also happens in local variable declarations. In this case, the return value of the call to ,tail.partition, is a ,tuple, — in this case, two lists. (Tuples differ from other types of containers, e.g. lists, in that they are always of fixed size and the elements can be of differing types — although here they are both the same.) Pattern matching is the easiest way of fetching the two parts of the tuple.
,The form ,_ < pivot, is a declaration of an ,anonymous function, with a placeholder variable; see the section above on anonymous functions.
,The list operators ,::, (which adds an element onto the beginning of a list, similar to ,cons, in Lisp and Scheme) and ,:::, (which appends two lists together, similar to ,append, in Lisp and Scheme) both appear. Despite appearances, there is nothing ""built-in"" about either of these operators. As specified above, any string of symbols can serve as function name, and a method applied to an object can be written "",infix,""-style without the period or parentheses. The line above as written:
,
,qsort(smaller) ::: pivot :: qsort(rest),
,could also be written thus:
,
,qsort(rest).::(pivot).:::(qsort(smaller)),
,in more standard method-call notation. (Methods that end with a colon are right-associative and bind to the object to the right.)
,
,Partial functions,[,edit,],
,In the pattern-matching example above, the body of the ,match, operator is a ,partial function,, which consists of a series of ,case, expressions, with the first matching expression prevailing, similar to the body of a ,switch statement,. Partial functions are also used in the exception-handling portion of a ,try, statement:
,
,try, ,{,
  ,...,
,}, ,catch, ,{,
  ,case, ,nfe,:,NumberFormatException, ,=>, ,{, ,println,(,nfe,);, ,List,(,0,), ,},
  ,case, ,_, ,=>, ,Nil,
,},
,
,Finally, a partial function can be used alone, and the result of calling it is equivalent to doing a ,match, over it. For example, the prior code for ,quicksort, can be written thus:
,
,val, ,qsort,:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=>, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,{,
  ,case, ,Nil, ,=>, ,Nil,
  ,case, ,pivot, ,::, ,tail, ,=>,
    ,val, ,(,smaller,,, ,rest,), ,=, ,tail,.,partition,(,_, ,<, ,pivot,),
    ,qsort,(,smaller,), ,:::, ,pivot, ,::, ,qsort,(,rest,),
,},
,
,Here a read-only ,variable, is declared whose type is a function from lists of integers to lists of integers, and bind it to a partial function. (Note that the single parameter of the partial function is never explicitly declared or named.) However, we can still call this variable exactly as if it were a normal function:
,
,scala,>, ,qsort,(,List,(,6,,,2,,,5,,,9,)),
,res32,:, ,List,[,Int,], ,=, ,List,(,2,,, ,5,,, ,6,,, ,9,),
,
,Object-oriented extensions,[,edit,],
,Scala is a pure ,object-oriented language, in the sense that every value is an ,object,. ,Data types, and behaviors of objects are described by ,classes, and ,traits,. Class abstractions are extended by ,subclassing, and by a flexible ,mixin,-based composition mechanism to avoid the problems of ,multiple inheritance,.
,Traits are Scala's replacement for Java's ,interfaces,. Interfaces in Java versions under 8 are highly restricted, able only to contain abstract function declarations. This has led to criticism that providing convenience methods in interfaces is awkward (the same methods must be reimplemented in every implementation), and extending a published interface in a backwards-compatible way is impossible. Traits are similar to ,mixin, classes in that they have nearly all the power of a regular abstract class, lacking only class parameters (Scala's equivalent to Java's constructor parameters), since traits are always mixed in with a class. The ,super, operator behaves specially in traits, allowing traits to be chained using composition in addition to inheritance. The following example is a simple window system:
,
,abstract, ,class, ,Window, ,{,
  ,// abstract,
  ,def, ,draw,(),
,},

,class, ,SimpleWindow, ,extends, ,Window, ,{,
  ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in SimpleWindow"",),
    ,// draw a basic window,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,WindowDecoration, ,extends, ,Window, ,{, ,},

,trait, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,// ""abstract override"" is needed here in order for ""super()"" to work because the parent,
  ,// function is abstract. If it were concrete, regular ""override"" would be enough.,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in HorizontalScrollbarDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw a horizontal scrollbar,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in VerticalScrollbarDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw a vertical scrollbar,
  ,},
,},

,trait, ,TitleDecoration, ,extends, ,WindowDecoration, ,{,
  ,abstract, ,override, ,def, ,draw,(), ,{,
    ,println,(,""in TitleDecoration"",),
    ,super,.,draw,(),
    ,// now draw the title bar,
  ,},
,},
,
,A variable may be declared thus:
,
,val, ,mywin, ,=, ,new, ,SimpleWindow, ,with, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration, ,with, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration, ,with, ,TitleDecoration,
,
,The result of calling ,mywin.draw(), is:
,
,in, ,TitleDecoration,
,in, ,HorizontalScrollbarDecoration,
,in, ,VerticalScrollbarDecoration,
,in, ,SimpleWindow,
,
,In other words, the call to ,draw, first executed the code in ,TitleDecoration, (the last trait mixed in), then (through the ,super(), calls) threaded back through the other mixed-in traits and eventually to the code in ,Window,, ,even though none of the traits inherited from one another,. This is similar to the ,decorator pattern,, but is more concise and less error-prone, as it doesn't require explicitly encapsulating the parent window, explicitly forwarding functions whose implementation isn't changed, or relying on run-time initialization of entity relationships. In other languages, a similar effect could be achieved at compile-time with a long linear chain of ,implementation inheritance,, but with the disadvantage compared to Scala that one linear inheritance chain would have to be declared for each possible combination of the mix-ins.
,
,Expressive type system,[,edit,],
,Scala is equipped with an expressive static type system that mostly enforces the safe and coherent use of abstractions. The type system is, however, not ,sound,.,[35], In particular, the type system supports:
,
,Classes, and ,abstract types, as object members,
,Structural types,
,Path-dependent types,
,Compound types,
,Explicitly typed self references,
,Generic classes,
,Polymorphic, methods,
,Upper and lower type bounds,
,Variance,
,Annotation,
,Views,
,Scala is able to ,infer types, by usage. This makes most static type declarations optional. Static types need not be explicitly declared unless a compiler error indicates the need. In practice, some static type declarations are included for the sake of code clarity.
,
,Type enrichment,[,edit,],
,A common technique in Scala, known as ""enrich my library"",[36], (originally termed as ""pimp my library"" by Martin Odersky in 2006;,[30], though concerns were raised about this phrasing due to its negative connotation,[37], and immaturity,[38],), allows new methods to be used as if they were added to existing types. This is similar to the C# concept of ,extension methods, but more powerful, because the technique is not limited to adding methods and can, for instance, be used to implement new interfaces. In Scala, this technique involves declaring an ,implicit conversion, from the type ""receiving"" the method to a new type (typically, a class) that wraps the original type and provides the additional method. If a method cannot be found for a given type, the compiler automatically searches for any applicable implicit conversions to types that provide the method in question.
,This technique allows new methods to be added to an existing class using an add-on library such that only code that ,imports, the add-on library gets the new functionality, and all other code is unaffected.
,The following example shows the enrichment of type ,Int, with methods ,isEven, and ,isOdd,:
,
,object, ,MyExtensions, ,{,
  ,implicit, ,class, ,IntPredicates,(,i,:, ,Int,), ,{,
    ,def, ,isEven, ,=, ,i, ,%, ,2, ,==, ,0,
    ,def, ,isOdd,  ,=, ,!,isEven,
  ,},
,},

,import, ,MyExtensions._,  ,// bring implicit enrichment into scope,
,4.,isEven,  ,// -> true,
,
,Importing the members of ,MyExtensions, brings the implicit conversion to extension class ,IntPredicates, into scope.,[39],
,
,Concurrency,[,edit,],
,Scala's standard library includes support for the ,actor model,, in addition to the standard Java concurrency APIs. ,Lightbend Inc., provides a platform,[40], that includes ,Akka,,,[41], a separate open-source framework that provides actor-based concurrency. Akka actors may be ,distributed, or combined with ,software transactional memory, (,transactors,). Alternative ,communicating sequential processes, (CSP) implementations for channel-based message passing are Communicating Scala Objects,,[42], or simply via ,JCSP,.
,An Actor is like a thread instance with a mailbox. It can be created by ,system.actorOf,, overriding the ,receive, method to receive messages and using the ,!, (exclamation point) method to send a message.,[43],
The following example shows an EchoServer that can receive messages and then print them.
,
,val, ,echoServer, ,=, ,actor,(,new, ,Act, ,{,
  ,become, ,{,
    ,case, ,msg, ,=>, ,println,(,""echo "", ,+, ,msg,),
  ,},
,}),
,echoServer, ,!, ,""hi"",
,
,Scala also comes with built-in support for data-parallel programming in the form of Parallel Collections,[44], integrated into its Standard Library since version 2.9.0.
,The following example shows how to use Parallel Collections to improve performance.,[45],
,
,val, ,urls, ,=, ,List,(,""https://scala-lang.org"",,,  ,""https://github.com/scala/scala"",),

,def, ,fromURL,(,url,:, ,String,), ,=, ,scala,.,io,.,Source,.,fromURL,(,url,),
  ,.,getLines,().,mkString,(,""\n"",),

,val, ,t, ,=, ,System,.,currentTimeMillis,(),
,urls,.,par,.,map,(,fromURL,(,_,)), ,// par returns parallel implementation of a collection,
,println,(,""time: "", ,+, ,(,System,.,currentTimeMillis, ,-, ,t,), ,+, ,""ms"",),
,
,Besides actor support and data-parallelism, Scala also supports asynchronous programming with Futures and Promises, software transactional memory, and event streams.,[46],
,
,Cluster computing,[,edit,],
,The most well-known open-source cluster-computing solution written in Scala is ,Apache Spark,. Additionally, ,Apache Kafka,, the ,publish–subscribe, ,message queue, popular with Spark and other stream processing technologies, is written in Scala.
,
,Testing,[,edit,],
,There are several ways to test code in Scala. ,ScalaTest, supports multiple testing styles and can integrate with Java-based testing frameworks.,[47], ,ScalaCheck, is a library similar to Haskell's ,QuickCheck,.,[48], ,specs2, is a library for writing executable software specifications.,[49], ,ScalaMock, provides support for testing high-order and curried functions.,[50], ,JUnit, and ,TestNG, are popular testing frameworks written in Java.

,Comparison with other JVM languages,[,edit,],
,Scala is often compared with ,Groovy, and ,Clojure,, two other programming languages also using the JVM. Substantial differences between these languages are found in the type system, in the extent to which each language supports object-oriented and functional programming, and in the similarity of their syntax to the syntax of Java.
,Scala is ,statically typed,, while both Groovy and Clojure are ,dynamically typed,. This makes the type system more complex and difficult to understand but allows almost all,[35], type errors to be caught at compile-time and can result in significantly faster execution. By contrast, dynamic typing requires more testing to ensure program correctness and is generally slower in order to allow greater programming flexibility and simplicity. Regarding speed differences, current versions of Groovy and Clojure allow for optional type annotations to help programs avoid the overhead of dynamic typing in cases where types are practically static. This overhead is further reduced when using recent versions of the JVM, which has been enhanced with an ,invoke dynamic, instruction for methods that are defined with dynamically typed arguments. These advances reduce the speed gap between static and dynamic typing, although a statically typed language, like Scala, is still the preferred choice when execution efficiency is very important.
,Regarding programming paradigms, Scala inherits the object-oriented model of Java and extends it in various ways. Groovy, while also strongly object-oriented, is more focused in reducing verbosity. In Clojure, object-oriented programming is deemphasised with functional programming being the main strength of the language. Scala also has many functional programming facilities, including features found in advanced functional languages like ,Haskell,, and tries to be agnostic between the two paradigms, letting the developer choose between the two paradigms or, more frequently, some combination thereof.
,Regarding syntax similarity with Java, Scala inherits much of Java's syntax, as is the case with Groovy. Clojure on the other hand follows the ,Lisp, syntax, which is different in both appearance and philosophy. However, learning Scala is also considered difficult because of its many advanced features. This is not the case with Groovy, despite its also being a feature-rich language, mainly because it was designed to be mainly a scripting language.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Adoption,[,edit,],
,Language rankings,[,edit,],
,As of 2013,[update],, all JVM-based languages (Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, Scala) are significantly less popular than the original Java language, which is usually ranked first or second,,[95],[96], and which is also simultaneously evolving over time.
,The Popularity of Programming Language Index,,[97], which tracks searches for language tutorials, ranked Scala 15th in April 2018 with a small downward trend. This makes Scala the most popular JVM-based language after Java, although immediately followed by ,Kotlin,, a JVM-based language with a strong upward trend ranked 16th.
,The ,TIOBE index,[96], of programming language popularity employs internet search engine rankings and similar publication-counting to determine language popularity. As of April 2018, it shows Scala in 34th place, having dropped four places over the last two years, but–as mentioned under ""Bugs & Change Requests""–TIOBE is aware of issues with its methodology of using search terms which might not be commonly used in some programming language communities. In this ranking Scala is ahead of some functional languages like ,Haskell, (42nd), ,Erlang,, but below other languages like ,Swift, (15th), ,Perl, (16th), ,Go, (19th) and ,Clojure, (30th).
,The ,ThoughtWorks, Technology Radar, which is an opinion based biannual report of a group of senior technologists,,[98], recommended Scala adoption in its languages and frameworks category in 2013.,[99], In July 2014, this assessment was made more specific and now refers to a ""Scala, the good parts"", which is described as ""To successfully use Scala, you need to research the language and have a very strong opinion on which parts are right for you, creating your own definition of Scala, the good parts."".,[100],
,The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings, which establishes rankings based on the number of ,GitHub, projects and questions asked on ,Stack Overflow,, ranks Scala 14th.,[95], Here, Scala is placed inside a second-tier group of languages–ahead of ,Go,, ,PowerShell, and ,Haskell,, and behind ,Swift,, ,Objective-C,, ,Typescript, and ,R,. However, in its 2018 report, the Rankings noted a drop of Scala's rank for the third time in a row, questioning ""how much of the available oxygen for Scala is consumed by Kotlin as the latter continues to rocket up these rankings"".,[95],
,In the 2018 edition of the ""State of Java"" survey,,[101], which collected data from 5160 developers on various Java-related topics, Scala places third in terms of usage of alternative languages on the JVM. Compared to the last year's edition of the survey, Scala's usage among alternative JVM languages fell by almost a quarter (from 28.4% to 21.5%), overtaken by Kotlin, which rose from 11.4% in 2017 to 28.8% in 2018.

The class can also be defined as ,implicit class IntPredicates(val i: Int) extends AnyVal { ... },, producing a so-called ,value class,, also introduced in Scala 2.10.

,
,OCaml, (,/,oʊ,ˈ,k,æ,m,əl,/, ,oh-,KAM,-əl,, formerly ,Objective Caml,) is a ,general-purpose,, ,multi-paradigm, ,programming language, which extends the ,Caml, dialect of ,ML, with ,object-oriented, features. OCaml was created in 1996 by ,Xavier Leroy,, Jérôme Vouillon, ,Damien Doligez,, Didier Rémy, ,Ascánder Suárez,, and others.
,The OCaml ,toolchain, includes an interactive top-level ,interpreter,, a ,bytecode, ,compiler,, an optimizing ,native code, compiler, a reversible ,debugger,, and a package manager (OPAM).  OCaml was initially developed in the context of ,automated theorem proving,, and has an outsize presence in ,static analysis, and ,formal methods, software. But it has found serious use beyond these areas, with major applications in ,systems programming,, ,web development,, and ,financial engineering,, among other application domains.
,The acronym ,CAML, originally stood for ,Categorical Abstract Machine Language,, but OCaml omits this ,abstract machine,.,[3], OCaml is a ,free and open-source software, project managed and principally maintained by the ,French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, (INRIA). In the early 2000s, elements from OCaml were adopted by many languages, notably ,F#, and ,Scala,.

,Philosophy,[,edit,],
,ML,-derived languages are best known for their static ,type systems, and ,type-inferring, compilers. OCaml unifies ,functional,, ,imperative,, and ,object-oriented programming, under an ML-like type system. Thus, programmers need not be highly familiar with the pure functional language paradigm to use OCaml.
,By requiring the programmer to work within the constraints of its static type system, OCaml eliminates many of the type-related runtime problems associated with dynamically typed languages. Also, OCaml's type-inferring compiler greatly reduces the need for the manual type annotations that are required in most statically typed languages. For example, the ,data type, of variables and the signature of functions usually need not be declared explicitly, as they do in languages like ,Java, and ,C#,, because they can be inferred from the operators and other functions that are applied to the variables and other values in the code. Effective use of OCaml's type system can require some sophistication on the part of a programmer, but this discipline is rewarded with reliable, high-performance software. 
,OCaml is perhaps most distinguished from other languages with origins in academia by its emphasis on performance. Its static type system prevents runtime type mismatches and thus obviates runtime type and safety checks that burden the performance of dynamically typed languages, while still guaranteeing runtime safety, except when array bounds checking is turned off or when some type-unsafe features like serialization are used. These are rare enough that avoiding them is quite possible in practice.
,Aside from type-checking overhead, ,functional programming, languages are, in general, challenging to compile to efficient machine language code, due to issues such as the ,funarg problem,. Along with standard loop, register, and instruction ,optimizations,, OCaml's optimizing compiler employs ,static program analysis, methods to optimize value ,boxing, and ,closure, allocation, helping to maximize the performance of the resulting code even if it makes extensive use of functional programming constructs.
,Xavier Leroy, has stated that ""OCaml delivers at least 50% of the performance of a decent C compiler"",,[4], although a direct comparison is impossible. Some functions in the OCaml standard library are implemented with faster algorithms than equivalent functions in the standard libraries of other languages. For example, the implementation of set union in the OCaml standard library in theory is asymptotically faster than the equivalent function in the standard libraries of imperative languages (e.g., C++, Java) because the OCaml implementation exploits the immutability of sets to reuse parts of input sets in the output (see ,persistent data structure,).
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,OCaml features a ,static, ,type system,, ,type inference,, ,parametric polymorphism,, ,tail recursion,, ,pattern matching,, first class lexical ,closures,, ,functors (parametric modules),, ,exception handling,, and incremental generational ,automatic garbage collection,.
,OCaml is notable for extending ML-style type inference to an object system in a general-purpose language. This permits ,structural subtyping,, where object types are compatible if their method signatures are compatible, regardless of their declared inheritance (an unusual feature in statically typed languages).
,A ,foreign function interface, for ,linking, to ,C, primitives is provided, including language support for efficient numerical ,arrays, in formats compatible with both C and ,Fortran,. OCaml also supports creating libraries of OCaml functions that can be linked to a ,main, program in C, so that an OCaml library can be distributed to C programmers who have no knowledge or installation of OCaml.
,The OCaml distribution contains:
,
,Lexical analysis, and ,parsing, tools called ,ocamllex, and ,ocamlyacc,
,Debugger, that supports stepping backwards to investigate errors,
,Documentation generator,
,Profiler, – to measure performance,
,Many general-purpose ,libraries,
,The native code compiler is available for many platforms, including ,Unix,, ,Microsoft Windows,, and ,Apple, ,macOS,. Portability is achieved through native ,code generation, support for major architectures: ,IA-32,, ,X86-64, (AMD64), ,Power,, ,SPARC,, ,ARM,, and ,ARM64,.,[5],
,OCaml bytecode and native code programs can be written in a ,multithreaded, style, with preemptive context switching. However, because the garbage collector of the INRIA OCaml system (which is the only currently available full implementation of the language) is not designed for concurrency, ,symmetric multiprocessing, is unsupported.,[6], OCaml threads in the same process execute by time sharing only. There are however several libraries for distributed computing such as ,Functory, and ,ocamlnet/Plasma,.
,
,Development environment,[,edit,],
,Since 2011, many new tools and libraries have been contributed to the OCaml development environment:
,
,Development tools
,opam, is a package manage for OCaml, developed by ,OCamlPro,.,
,Merlin, provides IDE-like functionality for multiple editors, including type throwback, go-to-definition, and auto-completion.,
,Dune, is a composable build-system for OCaml.,
,OCamlformat, is an auto-formatter for OCaml.,
,Web sites:
,OCaml.org, is the primary site for the language.,
,discuss.ocaml.org, is an instance of ,Discourse, that serves as the primary discussion site for OCaml.,
,Alternate compilers for OCaml:
,js_of_ocaml, developed by the ,Ocsigen, team, is an optimizing compiler from OCaml to ,JavaScript,.,
,BuckleScript,, which also targets ,JavaScript,, with a focus on producing readable, idiomatic JavaScript output.,
,ocamlcc is a compiler from OCaml to C, to complement the native code compiler for unsupported platforms.,
,OCamlJava, developed by INRIA, is a compiler from OCaml to the ,Java virtual machine, (JVM).,
,OCaPic, developed by Lip6, is an OCaml compiler for ,PIC microcontrollers,.,

,Snippets of OCaml code are most easily studied by entering them into the ,top-level,. This is an interactive OCaml session that prints the inferred types of resulting or defined expressions. The OCaml top-level is started by simply executing the OCaml program:
,
,$, ocaml
,     Objective Caml version 3.09.0,
,#,
,
,Code can then be entered at the ""#"" prompt. For example, to calculate 1+2*3:
,
,#, ,1, + ,2, * ,3,;;,
,- : int = 7,
,
,OCaml infers the type of the expression to be ""int"" (a ,machine-precision, ,integer,) and gives the result ""7"".
,
,Hello World,[,edit,],
,The following program ""hello.ml"":
,
,print_endline, ,""Hello World!"",
,
,can be compiled into a bytecode executable:
,
,$ ocamlc hello.ml -o hello
,
,or compiled into an optimized native-code executable:
,
,$ ocamlopt hello.ml -o hello
,
,and executed:
,
,$, ./hello
,Hello World!,
,$,
,
,The first argument to ocamlc, ""hello.ml"", specifies the source file to compile and the ""-o hello"" flag specifies the output file.,[7],
,
,Summing a list of integers,[,edit,],
,Lists are one of the fundamental datatypes in OCaml. The following code example defines a ,recursive, function ,sum, that accepts one argument, ,integers,, which is supposed to be a list of integers. Note the keyword ,rec, which denotes that the function is recursive. The function recursively iterates over the given list of integers and provides a sum of the elements. The ,match, statement has similarities to ,C,'s ,switch, element, though it is far more general.
,
,let, ,rec, ,sum, ,integers, ,=,                   ,(* Keyword rec means 'recursive'. *),
  ,match, ,integers, ,with,
  ,|, ,[], ,->, ,0,                              ,(* Yield 0 if integers is the empty ,
,                                            list []. *),
  ,|, ,first, ,::, ,rest, ,->, ,first, ,+, ,sum, ,rest,;;,  ,(* Recursive call if integers is a non-,
,                                            empty list; first is the first ,
,                                            element of the list, and rest is a ,
,                                            list of the rest of the elements, ,
,                                            possibly []. *),
,
,  ,#, ,sum, ,[,1,;,2,;,3,;,4,;,5,];;,
  ,-, ,:, ,int, ,=, ,15,
,
,Another way is to use standard ,fold function, that works with lists.

,Since the ,anonymous function, is simply the application of the + operator, this can be shortened to:
,
,let, ,sum, ,integers, ,=,
  ,List,.,fold_left, ,(+), ,0, ,integers,
,
,Furthermore, one can omit the list argument by making use of a ,partial application,:
,

,Birthday problem,[,edit,],
,The following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of completely unique birthdays is less than 50% (the ,birthday problem,, where for 1 person the probability is 365/365 (or 100%), for 2 it is 364/365, for 3 it is 364/365 × 363/365, etc.) (answer = 23).

,
,Church numerals,[,edit,],
,The following code defines a ,Church encoding, of ,natural numbers,, with successor (succ) and addition (add). A Church numeral ,n, is a ,higher-order function, that accepts a function ,f, and a value ,x, and applies ,f, to ,x, exactly ,n, times. To convert a Church numeral from a functional value to a string, we pass it a function that prepends the string ,""S"", to its input and the constant string ,""0"",.
,
,let, ,zero, ,f, ,x, ,=, ,x,
,let, ,succ, ,n, ,f, ,x, ,=, ,f, ,(,n, ,f, ,x,),
,let, ,one, ,=, ,succ, ,zero,

,let, ,to_string, ,n, ,=, ,n, ,(,fun, ,k, ,->, ,""S"", ,^, ,k,), ,""0"",
,let, ,_, ,=, ,to_string, ,(,add, ,(,succ, ,two,), ,two,),
,
,Arbitrary-precision factorial function (libraries),[,edit,],
,A variety of libraries are directly accessible from OCaml. For example, OCaml has a built-in library for ,arbitrary-precision arithmetic,. As the factorial function grows very rapidly, it quickly overflows machine-precision numbers (typically 32- or 64-bits). Thus, factorial is a suitable candidate for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
,In OCaml, the Num module (now superseded by the ZArith module) provides arbitrary-precision arithmetic and can be loaded into a running top-level using:
,
,
,#, ,#,use, ,""topfind"",;;,
,#, ,#,require, ,""num"",;;,
,#, ,open, ,Num,;;,
,
,
,The factorial function may then be written using the arbitrary-precision numeric operators ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},=/,, ,*/, and ,-/, :
,
,#, ,let, ,rec, ,fact, ,n, ,=,
    ,if, ,n, ,=/, ,Int, ,0, ,then, ,Int, ,1, ,else, ,n, ,*/, ,fact,(,n, ,-/, ,Int, ,1,);;,
,val, ,fact, ,:, ,Num,.,num, ,->, ,Num,.,num, ,=, ,<,fun,>,
,
,This function can compute much larger factorials, such as 120!:
,
,#, ,string_of_num, ,(,fact, ,(,Int, ,120,));;,
,-, ,:, ,string, ,=,
,""6689502913449127057588118054090372586752746333138029810295671352301633,

,Triangle (graphics),[,edit,],
,The following program renders a rotating triangle in 2D using ,OpenGL,:
,
,let, ,(), ,=,
  ,ignore, ,(,Glut,.,init, ,Sys,.,argv,);,
  ,Glut,.,initDisplayMode, ,~,double_buffer,:,true, ,(),;,

  ,Glut,.,idleFunc, ,~,cb,:(,Some, ,Glut,.,postRedisplay,);,
  ,Glut,.,mainLoop, ,(),
,
,The LablGL bindings to OpenGL are required. The program may then be compiled to bytecode with:
,
,  $ ocamlc -I +lablGL lablglut.cma lablgl.cma simple.ml -o simple
,
,or to nativecode with:
,
,  $ ocamlopt -I +lablGL lablglut.cmxa lablgl.cmxa simple.ml -o simple
,
,or, more simply, using the ocamlfind build command
,
,  $ ocamlfind opt simple.ml -package lablgl.glut -linkpkg -o simple
,
,and run:
,
,  $ ./simple
,
,Far more sophisticated, high-performance 2D and 3D graphical programs can be developed in OCaml. Thanks to the use of OpenGL and OCaml, the resulting programs can be cross-platform, compiling without any changes on many major platforms.
,
,Fibonacci sequence,[,edit,],
,The following code calculates the ,Fibonacci sequence, of a number ,n, inputted. It uses ,tail recursion, and pattern matching.
,
,let, ,fib, ,n, ,=,
  ,let, ,rec, ,fib_aux, ,m, ,a, ,b, ,=,
    ,match, ,m, ,with,
    ,|, ,0, ,->, ,a,

  ,in, ,fib_aux, ,n, ,0, ,1,
,
,Higher-order functions,[,edit,],
,Functions may take functions as input and return functions as result. For example, applying ,twice, to a function ,f, yields a function that applies ,f, two times to its argument.
,
,let, ,twice, ,(,f, ,:, ,',a, ,->, ,',a,), ,=, ,fun, ,(,x, ,:, ,',a,), ,->, ,f, ,(,f, ,x,);;,
,let, ,inc, ,(,x, ,:, ,int,), ,:, ,int, ,=, ,x, ,+, ,1,;;,
,let, ,add2, ,=, ,twice, ,inc,;;,
,let, ,inc_str, ,(,x, ,:, ,string,), ,:, ,string, ,=, ,x, ,^, ,"" "", ,^, ,x,;;,
,let, ,add_str, ,=, ,twice,(,inc_str,);;,
,

,  ,-, ,:, ,int, ,=, ,100,
,  ,#, ,add_str, ,""Test"",;;,
,  ,-, ,:, ,string, ,=, ,""Test Test Test Test"",
,
,The function ,twice, uses a type variable, 'a, to indicate that it can be applied to any function ,f, mapping from a type, 'a, to itself, rather than only to ,int->int, functions. In particular, ,twice, can even be applied to itself.
,
,  ,#, ,let, ,fourtimes, ,f, ,=, ,(,twice, ,twice,), ,f,;;,
,  ,val, ,fourtimes, ,:, ,(,',a, ,->, ,',a,), ,->, ,',a, ,->, ,',a, ,=, ,<,fun,>,
,  ,#, ,let, ,add4, ,=, ,fourtimes, ,inc,;;,
,  ,val, ,add4, ,:, ,int, ,->, ,int, ,=, ,<,fun,>,
,  ,#, ,add4, ,98,;;,
,  ,-, ,:, ,int, ,=, ,102,
,
,Derived languages,[,edit,],
,MetaOCaml,[,edit,],
,MetaOCaml,[8], is a ,multi-stage programming, extension of OCaml enabling incremental compiling of new ,machine code, during runtime. Under some circumstances, significant speedups are possible using multistage programming, because more detailed information about the data to process is available at runtime than at the regular compile time, so the incremental compiler can optimize away many cases of condition checking, etc.
,As an example: if at compile time it is known that some ,power function, ,x, ,->, ,x,^,n, is needed often, but the value of ,n, is known only at runtime, a two-stage power function can be used in MetaOCaml:
,
, ,let, ,rec, ,power, ,n, ,x, ,=,
   ,if, ,n, ,=, ,0,
   ,then, ,.<,1,>.,
   ,else,
     ,if, ,even, ,n,
     ,then, ,sqr, ,(,power, ,(,n,/,2,), ,x,),
     ,else, ,.<.~,x, ,*., ,.~(,power, ,(,n, ,-, ,1,), ,x,)>.,
,
,As soon as ,n, is known at runtime, a specialized and very fast power function can be created:
,
, ,.<,fun, ,x, ,->, ,.~(,power, ,5, ,.<,x,>.)>.,
,
,The result is:
,
, ,fun, ,x_1, ,->, ,(,x_1, ,*,
     ,let, ,y_3, ,=, 
         ,let, ,y_2, ,=, ,(,x_1, ,*, ,1,),
         ,in, ,(,y_2, ,*, ,y_2,),
     ,in, ,(,y_3, ,*, ,y_3,)),
,
,The new function is automatically compiled.

 本页面最后修订于2019年11月10日 (星期日) 03:13。,"终身仁慈独裁者,（英語：,Benevolent Dictator For Life,，缩写,BDFL,）是少数,开源软件,开发者所拥有的头衔。他们通常是某一项目的创始人，并在该项目社区出现争议时拥有最终的决定权。
,这一称号诞生于1995年，最初用来指,Python语言,的创始人,吉多·范罗苏姆,。,[1],[2],当时在范罗苏姆刚加入,全国研究创新联合会,（,英语,：,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,）,后，,肯马·内梅尔,（,英语,：,Ken Manheimer,）,在一封邮件中试图创立一个监管Python语言开发的半正式团体。他在该邮件中首次使用了BDFL这一称呼，并戏称范罗苏姆为“首任临时BDFL”。,[1],2018年7月12日，范罗苏姆宣布不再出任Python语言的BDFL。,[3],
,值得一提的是，BDFL与另一个用来指开源运动领导人的称呼“仁慈的独裁者”（benevolent dictator）的含义并不一致。后者因,埃里克·雷蒙,的《,开拓智域,》（Homesteading the Noosphere）一文而广为人知。雷蒙在文中提到，开源软件运动的本质会促使“独裁者”保持仁慈，否则巨大的分歧会导致项目被,复刻,并由新的领导所掌管。,[4],

,Keras, is an ,open-source, ,neural-network, library written in ,Python,. It is capable of running on top of ,TensorFlow,, ,Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit,, ,R,, ,Theano,, or ,PlaidML,.,[2],[3],[4], Designed to enable fast experimentation with ,deep neural networks,, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System),,[5], and its primary author and maintainer is François Chollet, a ,Google, engineer. Chollet also is the author of the XCeption deep neural network model.,[6],
,In 2017, Google's TensorFlow team decided to support Keras in TensorFlow's core library.,[7], Chollet explained that Keras was conceived to be an interface rather than a standalone ,machine learning, framework. It offers a higher-level, more intuitive set of abstractions that make it easy to develop deep learning models regardless of the computational backend used.,[8], ,Microsoft, added a ,CNTK, backend to Keras as well, available as of CNTK v2.0.,[9],[10],

,Features,[,edit,],
,Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, ,objectives,, ,activation functions,, ,optimizers,, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code. The code is hosted on ,GitHub,, and community support forums include the GitHub issues page, and a ,Slack, channel.
,In addition to standard neural networks, Keras has support for ,convolutional, and ,recurrent neural networks,. It supports other common utility layers like ,dropout,, ,batch normalization,, and ,pooling,.,[11],
,Keras allows users to productize deep models on smartphones (,iOS, and ,Android,), on the web, or on the ,Java Virtual Machine,.,[3], It also allows use of distributed training of deep-learning models on clusters of ,Graphics processing units (GPU), and ,tensor processing units (TPU), principally in conjunction with ,CUDA,.,[12],
,
,Traction,[,edit,],
,Keras claims over 250,000 individual users as of mid-2018.,[3], Keras was the 10th most cited tool in the ,KDnuggets, 2018 software poll and registered a 22% usage.,[13],

,Customer relationship management, (,CRM,) is an approach to managing a company's interaction with current and potential ,customers,. It uses ,data analysis, about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on ,customer retention, and ultimately driving ,sales, growth.,[1],
,One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile ,data, from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.,[2], Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs.

,Software history,[,edit,],
,The concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking.,[3], At that time, businesses had to rely on ,standalone mainframe systems, to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in ,spreadsheets, and lists. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestnbaum introduced the concept of ,Database marketing,, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data.,[,citation needed,], By 1986, ,Pat Sullivan, and ,Mike Muhney, released a customer evaluation system called ,ACT!, based on the principle of digital rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.
,The trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize leads' potential, including ,Tom Siebel,, who designed the first CRM product ,Siebel Systems, in 1993.,[4], In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions the established ,enterprise resource planning, (ERP) software companies like ,Oracle,, ,SAP,,,[5], ,Peoplesoft, and ,Navision,[6], started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with ,embedded CRM modules,. This included embedding ,sales force automation, or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.
,Customer relationship management was popularized in 1997, due to the work of Siebel, ,Gartner,, and ,IBM,. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities.,[7], Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted and moveable customer bases was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including ,PeopleSoft,, ,Oracle,, ,SAP, and ,Salesforce.com,.,[8],
,The first open-source CRM system was developed by ,SugarCRM, in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction.,[7], Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum, and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favorite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively ,social CRM, solutions, including ,Base, and ,Nutshell,.,[7], The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions.,[9], In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business.,[10], In November 2016, ,Forrester, released a report where it ""identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors"".,[11],
,
,Types,[,edit,],
,Strategic,[,edit,],
,Strategic CRM is concentrated upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.,[12],
,
,Operational,[,edit,],
,The primary goal of customer relationship management systems is to integrate and ,automate, sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a ,single customer view,, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of 3 main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.,[13],
,
,Sales force automation, works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client.,[14], It implements ,sales promotion, analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.,[14],[15],
,Marketing automation, focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers, or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on ,customer engagement, through social media.,[16],
,Service automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, ,knowledge bases,, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.,[13],
,Analytical,[,edit,],
,The role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions.,[17], Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and ,pattern recognition, to analyze the customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently.,[13], For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After scanning through this data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently, in order to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.,[18],
,
,Collaborative,[,edit,],
,The third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organisations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.,[19],
,
,Customer Data Platform,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Customer data platform,
,A ,customer data platform, (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.,[20],  As of February 2017 there were about twenty companies selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.,[20],
,
,Components,[,edit,],
,  ,Components in the different types of CRM,[19],The main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of its marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgement of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. Through studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.,[21],
,Relational Intelligence, or awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm, is an important component to the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing ,demographic data,, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into ,profitability, tiers, but this is only a firm's mechanical view of customer relationships.,[22], This therefore is a sign that firms believe that customers are still resources that can be used for ,up-sell, or ,cross-sell, opportunities, rather than humans looking for interesting and personalized interactions.,[23],
,CRM systems include:
,
,Data warehouse, technology, used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.,
,Opportunity management, which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand, and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.,[24],
,CRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.,
,Some CRM software is available as a ,software as a service, (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it, but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.,[13],
,For small businesses a CRM system may consist of a contact manager system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial ,return on investment, (ROI).,
,CRM systems for ,eCommerce,, focused on marketing automation tasks, like: cart rescue, re-engage users with email, personalization.,
,Customer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.,[21],
,Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.,
,CRM not only indicates to technology and strategy but also indicates to an integrated approach which includes employees knowledge, organizational culture to em-brass the CRM philosophy.,
,Effect on customer satisfaction,[,edit,],
,Customer satisfaction, has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection.,[25],[26], The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to have an effect on customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.
,Firstly, firms are able to customize their offerings for each customer.,[27], By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers.,[27], This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts.,[27], For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service ,experience, across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and a reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction.,[28], Furthermore, CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.,[29],
,
,Customer benefits,[,edit,],
,With Customer relationship management systems, customers are served better on day to day process. With more reliable information, their demand for ,self service, from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, ,customer satisfaction, level increases.,[30], These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity that are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to ,customer equity,. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.,[31],
,
,Enhanced ability to ,target, profitable customers.,
,Integrated assistance across channels.,
,Enhanced ,sales force, efficiency and effectiveness.,
,Improved ,pricing,.,
,Customized products and services.,
,Improved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.,
,Individualized marketing messages also called campaigns.,
,Connect customers and all channels on a single platform. ,
,In 2012, after reviewing the previous studies, someone selected some of those benefits which are more significant in customer's satisfaction and summarized them into the following cases:,[32],
,
,Improve customer services: In general, customers would have some questions, concerns or requests. CRM services provide the ability to a company for producing, allocating and managing requests or something made by customers. For example, ,call center, software, which helps to connect a customer to the manager or person who can best assist them with their existing problem, is one of the CRM abilities that can be implemented to increase efficiency.,[33],
,Increased personalized service or one-to-one service: ,Personalizing, customer service or one-to-one service provides companies to improve understanding and gaining knowledge of the customers and also to have better knowledge about their customers' preferences, requirements and demands.,
,Responsive to customer's needs: Customers' situations and needs can be understood by the firms focusing on customer needs and requirements.,[34],
,Customer segmentation: In CRM, ,segmentation, is used to ,categorize, customers, according to some similarity, such as industry, job or some other characteristics, into similar groups.,[35], Although these characteristics, can be one or more attributes. It can be defined as a subdividing the customers based on already known good discriminator.,
,Improve customization of marketing: Meaning of customization of marketing is that, the firm or organization adapt and change its services or products based on presenting a different and unique product or services for each customer. With the purpose of ensuring that customer needs and requirements are met Customization is used by the organization. Companies can put investment in information from customers and then customize their products or services to maintain customer interests.,
,Multichannel integration: ,Multichannel, integration shows the point of co creation of customer value in CRM. On the other hand, a company's skill to perform multichannel integration successfully, is heavily dependent on the organization's ability getting together customer information from all channels and incorporate it with other related information.,[36],
,Time saving: CRM will let companies to interact with customers more frequently, by personalized message and communication way which can be produced rapidly and matched on a timely basis, and finally they can better understand their customers and therefore look forward to their needs.,[37],
,Improve customer knowledge: Firms can make and improve products and services through the information from tracking (e.g. via ,website tracking,) ,customer behaviour, to customer tastes and needs.,[38], CRM could contribute to a competitive advantage in improving firm's ability of customer information collecting to customize products and services according to customer needs.,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,Research has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance.,[39], Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, ,MBNA, Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.,[39],
,Amazon, has also seen great success through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.,[39],
,
,Customer profile,[,edit,],
,Further information: ,Consumer behaviour,, ,Biology and consumer behaviour,, and ,Buying decision,
,Customer or consumer profiles are the essence of the ,data, that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through ,customer analytics, methods, essentially a type of ,profiling,. A customer is abstracted to information that sums up ,consumption, habits so far and ,projects them into the future, so that they can be grouped for marketing and ,advertising, purposes.,[40],
,
,Improving CRM within a firm,[,edit,],
,Consultants argue that it is important for companies establishing strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence.,[41], According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate or anything in between.,[23],
,
,Analyzing the information,[,edit,],
,Managers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can ,collect, this information by using ,surveys,, interviews, and more, with current customers. For example, ,Frito-Lay, conducted many ,ethnographic, interviews with customers to try and understand the relationships they wanted with the companies and the brands. They found that most customers were adults who used the product to feel more playful. They may have enjoyed the company's bright orange color, messiness, and shape.,[42],
,Companies must also improve their relational intelligence of their CRM systems. These days, companies store and receive huge amounts of data through ,emails,, ,online chat, sessions, phone calls, and more.,[43], Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence.,[22], Companies can use ,data mining, technologies and ,web searches, to understand relational signals. ,Social media, such as social networking sites, ,blogs,, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customer's signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.,[42],
,
,Employee training,[,edit,],
,Many firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and effectively create strong customer–brand relationships. For example, ,Harley Davidson, sent its employees on the road with customers, who were motorcycle enthusiasts, to help solidify relationships. Other employees have also been trained in ,social psychology, and the ,social sciences, to help bolster strong customer relationships. ,Customer service, representatives must be educated to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.,[44],
,
,Application,[,edit,],
,Applying new technologies while using CRM systems requires changes in infrastructure of the organization as well as deployment of new technologies such as business rules, ,databases, and ,information technology,.,[42],
,
,In practice,[,edit,],
,Call centers,[,edit,],
,Contact center, CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between company and customers by using analytics and ,key performance indicators, to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize ,average revenue per user,, decrease ,churn rate, and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.,[45],[46],[47],
,Growing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.,[48],
,Gamification, tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.,[49],
,
,Contact-center automation,[,edit,],
,Contact-center ,automation,, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number in order to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question.,[50], Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.,[16],
,
,Social media,[,edit,],
,Social CRM, involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers.,[51], Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use,[23], these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand.
,Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.,[19],
,Enterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.,[52],
,
,Location-based services,[,edit,],
,CRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular ,location-based, GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.,[16],
,
,Business-to-business transactions,[,edit,],
,Despite the general notion that CRM systems were created for the customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.,[53],
,The main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and ,business-to-business, CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.,[54],
,
,CRM market,[,edit,],
,The overall CRM market grew by 12.3 percent in 2015.,[55], In 2018 it grew by 15.6% and reached $48.2 billion. The following table lists the top vendors in 2012-2018 (figures in millions of US dollars) published in ,Gartner, studies.,[55],[56],[57],[58],[59],

,The four largest vendors of stand-alone or embedded CRM system offerings are ,Salesforce,, ,SAP,, ,Oracle,, and ,Microsoft,, which represented 42 percent of the market in 2015.,[55], SAP, Oracle and Microsoft offer CRM also as ,integral part of a bigger ERP solution, whereas Salesforces offers stand-alone CRM only. Other providers also are popular for small and mid market businesses. Splitting CRM providers into nine different categories (Enterprise CRM Suite, Midmarket CRM Suite, Small-Business CRM Suite, ,sales force automation,, incentive management, marketing solutions, ,business intelligence,, ,data quality,, ,consultancies,), each category has a different market leader. Additionally, applications often focus on professional fields such as ,healthcare,, ,manufacturing,, and other areas with branch-specific requirements.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Market trends,[,edit,],
,In the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like ""system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites"" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.,[60], Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (,cloud computing,) and SaaS. Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.,[61], ,Salesforce.com, was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.,[62],
,Traditional providers have recently moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: ,Oracle, purchased ,RightNow, in October 2011,[63], and ,SAP, acquired ,SuccessFactors, in December 2011.,[64],
,The era of the ""social customer"" refers to the use of social media by customers.,[65],
,Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing ,sales effectiveness, and increasing sales ,productivity, is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM. Empowering ,sales managers, was listed as one of the top 5 CRM trends in 2013.,[66],
,Another related development is ,vendor relationship management, (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's ,Berkman Center for Internet & Society, and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of ,CRM, Magazine.,[67],
,Pharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.,[68],
,Another trend worth noting is the rise of ,Customer Success, as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for more holistic understanding of the customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space.,[69], As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market, while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites. In 2017, ,artificial intelligence, and ,predictive analytics, were identified as the newest trends in CRM.,[70],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],

,Companies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably.,[71], They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients who want to be treated more like a friend may be treated like just a party for exchange, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan.,[23], In 2003, a ,Gartner, report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.,[72], Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.,[73], In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems.,[74], However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among the developing countries' consumers.,[75],
,Collection, of customer data such as ,personally identifiable information, must strictly obey ,customer privacy, ,laws,, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.
,Part of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company.,[76], The CRM paradox, also referred to as the ""dark side of CRM"",,[77], may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers.
,CRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly, so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communications with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.,[16],

,History,[,edit,],
,Early concept,[,edit,],
,Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ,ruby-talk, mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:,[16],
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a ,toy language, (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew ,Python, then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language –  OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it.,
,Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple ,Lisp, language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by ,higher-order functions,, and practical utility like that of Perl.,[17],
,
,The name ""Ruby"",[,edit,],
,The name ""Ruby"" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.,[18], Initially two names were proposed: "",Coral,"" and "",Ruby,"". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.,[19], Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name ""Ruby"" – it was the ,birthstone, of one of his colleagues.,[20],[21],
,
,First publication,[,edit,],
,The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic ,newsgroups, on December 21, 1995.,[22],[23], Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days.,[18], The release coincided with the launch of the ,Japanese-language, ,ruby-list, mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language.
,Already present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, including ,object-oriented, design, ,classes, with inheritance, ,mixins,, ,iterators,, ,closures,, ,exception handling, and ,garbage collection,.,[24],
,
,Early releases,[,edit,],
,Following the release of Ruby 0.95 in 1995, several stable versions of Ruby were released in the following years:
,
,Ruby 1.0: December 25, 1996,[18],
,Ruby 1.2: December 1998,
,Ruby 1.4: August 1999,
,Ruby 1.6: September 2000,
,In 1997, the first article about Ruby was published on the Web. In the same year, Matsumoto was hired by netlab.jp to work on Ruby as a full-time developer.,[18],
,In 1998, the Ruby Application Archive was launched by Matsumoto, along with a simple English-language homepage for Ruby.,[18],
,In 1999, the first English language mailing list ,ruby-talk, began, which signaled a growing interest in the language outside Japan.,[25], In this same year, Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka wrote the first book on Ruby, ,The Object-oriented Scripting Language Ruby, (オブジェクト指向スクリプト言語 Ruby), which was published in Japan in October 1999. It would be followed in the early 2000s by around 20 books on Ruby published in Japanese.,[18],
,By 2000, Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan.,[26], In September 2000, the first English language book ,Programming Ruby, was printed, which was later freely released to the public, further widening the adoption of Ruby amongst English speakers. In early 2002, the English-language ,ruby-talk, mailing list was receiving more messages than the Japanese-language ,ruby-list,, demonstrating Ruby's increasing popularity in the non-Japanese speaking world.
,
,Ruby 1.8,[,edit,],
,Ruby 1.8 was initially released August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013.,[27], Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is only partially compatible with Ruby 1.9.
,Ruby 1.8 has been the subject of several industry standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a ,Japanese government, agency) for submission to the ,Japanese Industrial Standards Committee, (JISC) and then to the ,International Organization for Standardization, (ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in 2011,[28], and an international standard (,ISO/IEC 30170,) in 2012.,[29],[30],
,Around 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem with ,Ruby on Rails,, a ,web framework, written in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with increasing awareness of Ruby.,[31],
,
,Ruby 1.9,[,edit,],
,Ruby 1.9 was released on Christmas Day in 2007. Effective with Ruby 1.9.3, released October 31, 2011,,[32], Ruby switched from being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the GPL to being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the two-clause BSD license.,[33], Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 that required many popular third party ,gems, to be rewritten.
,Ruby 1.9 introduces many significant changes over the 1.8 series.,[34],  Examples:
,
,block local, variables (variables that are local to the ,block, in which they are declared),
,an additional ,lambda, syntax: ,f, ,=, ,->,(,a,,,b,), ,{, ,puts, ,a, ,+, ,b, ,},
,an additional ,Hash, literal syntax using colons for symbol keys: ,{,symbol_key,:, ,""value"",}, ,==, ,{,:symbol_key, ,=>, ,""value"",},
,per-string ,character encodings, are supported,
,new socket API (,IPv6, support),
,require_relative, import security,
,Ruby 1.9 has been obsolete since February 23, 2015,,[35], and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes. Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version.
,
,Ruby 2.0,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.0 added several new features, including:
,
,method keyword arguments,,
,a new method, ,Module#prepend,, for extending a class,,
,a new literal for creating an array of symbols,,
,new API for the ,lazy evaluation, of Enumerables, and,
,a new convention of using #to_h to convert objects to Hashes.,[36],
,Ruby 2.0 is intended to be fully backward compatible with Ruby 1.9.3. As of the official 2.0.0 release on February 24, 2013, there were only five known (minor) incompatibilities.,[37],
,It has been obsolete since February 22, 2016,,[38], and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes. Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version.
,
,Ruby 2.1,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.1.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2013.,[39], The release includes speed-ups, bugfixes, and library updates.
,Starting with 2.1.0, Ruby's versioning policy is more like ,semantic versioning,.,[40], Although similar, Ruby's versioning policy is not compatible with semantic versioning:
,
,

,
,Ruby,
,Semantic versioning
,
,
,MAJOR,: Increased when incompatible change which can't be released in MINOR. Reserved for special events.,
,MAJOR,: Increased when you make incompatible API changes.
,
,
,MINOR,: increased every Christmas, ,may be, API incompatible.,
,MINOR,: increased when you add functionality in a ,backwards-compatible, manner.
,
,
,TEENY,: security or bug fix which maintains API compatibility. May be increased more than 10 (such as 2.1.11), and will be released every 2–3 months.,
,PATCH,: increased when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
,
,
,PATCH,: number of commits since last MINOR release (will be reset at 0 when releasing MINOR).,
,-
,
,Semantic versioning also provides additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, not available at Ruby.
,Ruby 2.1 has been obsolete since April 1, 2017,,[41], and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes. Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version.
,
,Ruby 2.2,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.2.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2014.,[42], The release includes speed-ups, bugfixes, and library updates and removes some deprecated APIs. Most notably, Ruby 2.2.0 introduces changes to memory handling –  an incremental garbage collector, support for garbage collection of symbols and the option to compile directly against jemalloc. It also contains experimental support for using ,vfork,(2) with system() and spawn(), and added support for the ,Unicode, 7.0 specification.
,Features that were made obsolete or removed include callcc, the DL library, Digest::HMAC, lib/rational.rb, lib/complex.rb, GServer, Logger::Application as well as various C API functions.,[43],
,Ruby 2.2 has been obsolete since April 1, 2018,,[44], and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes. Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version.
,
,PowerPC64 performance,
,Since version 2.2.1,,[45], Ruby MRI performance on ,PowerPC64, was improved.,[46],[47],[48],
,Ruby 2.3,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.3.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2015. A few notable changes include:
,
,The ability to mark all ,string literals, as frozen by default with a consequently large performance increase in string operations.,[49],
,Hash comparison to allow direct checking of key/value pairs instead of just keys.,
,A new ,safe navigation operator, ,&., that can ease nil handling (e.g. instead of ,if, ,obj, ,&&, ,obj,.,foo, ,&&, ,obj,.,foo,.,bar,, we can use ,if obj&.foo&.bar,).,
,The ,did_you_mean, gem is now bundled by default and required on startup to automatically suggest similar name matches on a ,NameError, or ,NoMethodError,.,
,Hash#dig, and ,Array#dig, to easily extract deeply nested values (e.g. given ,profile, ,=, ,{, ,social,:, ,{, ,wikipedia,:, ,{, ,name,:, ,'Foo Baz', ,}, ,}, ,},, the value ,Foo Baz, can now be retrieved by ,profile.dig(:social, :wikipedia, :name),).,
,.grep_v(regexp), which will match all negative examples of a given regular expression in addition to other new features.,
,The 2.3 branch also includes many performance improvements, updates, and bugfixes including changes to Proc#call, Socket and IO use of exception keywords, Thread#name handling, default passive Net::FTP connections, and Rake being removed from stdlib.,[50],
,
,Ruby 2.4,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.4.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2016. A few notable changes include:
,
,Binding#irb: Start a REPL session similar to binding.pry,
,Unify ,Fixnum, and ,Bignum, into ,Integer, class,
,String supports Unicode case mappings, not just ASCII,
,A new method, Regexp#match?, which is a faster boolean version of Regexp#match,
,Thread deadlock detection now shows threads with their backtrace and dependency,
,The 2.4 branch also includes performance improvements to hash table, Array#max, Array#min, and instance variable access.,[51],
,
,Ruby 2.5,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.5.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2017.,[52], A few notable changes include:
,
,rescue, and ,ensure, statements automatically use a surrounding ,do-end, block (less need for extra ,begin-end, blocks),
,Method-chaining with ,yield_self,
,Support branch coverage and method coverage measurement,
,Easier Hash transformations with ,Hash#slice, and ,Hash#transform_keys,
,On top of that come a lot of performance improvements like faster block passing (3 times faster), faster Mutexes, faster ERB templates and improvements on some concatenation methods.
,
,Ruby 2.6,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.6.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2018.,[53], A few notable changes include:
,
,JIT (experimental),
,RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree, (experimental),
,Ruby 2.7,[,edit,],
,Ruby 2.7.0 was released on Christmas Day in 2019.,[54], A few notable changes include:
,
,Pattern Matching (experimental),
,REPL improvement,
,Compaction GC,
,Separation of positional and keyword arguments,

,Philosophy,[,edit,],
,  ,Yukihiro Matsumoto,, the creator of Ruby,
,Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good ,user interface, design.,[89], At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 Matsumoto further stated, ""I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."",[90], He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs:,[91],
,
,Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, ""By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something."" They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.,
,Ruby is said to follow the ,principle of least astonishment, (POLA), meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment to the design of Ruby,,[91], but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take it to mean that Ruby's behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for those familiar with the standard.,[92],
,Matsumoto defined it this way in an interview:,[91],
,
,Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least ,my, surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me.,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Thoroughly ,object-oriented, with ,inheritance,, ,mixins, and ,metaclasses,[93],
,Dynamic typing, and ,duck typing,

,Semantics,[,edit,],
,Ruby is ,object-oriented,: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as ,integers,, booleans, and "",null,""). Variables always hold references to objects. Every ,function, is a ,method, and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as ""global"" procedures. Ruby supports ,inheritance, with ,dynamic dispatch,, ,mixins, and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single ,instance, rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support ,multiple inheritance,, classes can import ,modules, as mixins.
,Ruby has been described as a ,multi-paradigm programming language,: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or ,functional programming, (it has ,anonymous functions,, ,closures,, and ,continuations,; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for ,introspection,, ,reflection, and ,metaprogramming,, as well as support for interpreter-based,[99], ,threads,. Ruby features ,dynamic typing,, and supports ,parametric polymorphism,.
,According to the Ruby FAQ, the syntax is similar to ,Perl, and the semantics are similar to ,Smalltalk,, but it differs greatly from ,Python,.,[100],
,
,Syntax,[,edit,],
,The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of ,Perl, and ,Python,. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be both be defined by keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a ,sigil,. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between ,expressions, and ,statements,.,[101],[102], Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant.
,One of the differences from Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (,attr_writer,, ,attr_reader,, etc.). Unlike the ""getter"" and ""setter"" methods of other languages like ,C++, or ,Java,, accessor methods in Ruby can be created with a single line of code via ,metaprogramming,; however, accessor methods can also be created in the traditional fashion of C++ and Java. As invocation of these methods does not require the use of parentheses, it is trivial to change an instance variable into a full function, without modifying a single line of calling code or having to do any refactoring achieving similar functionality to ,C#, and ,VB.NET, property members.
,Python's property descriptors are similar, but come with a trade-off in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class may need to be adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby's design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare ,set, and ,get, methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.

,
,{, ,puts, ,'Hello, World!', ,}, ,# note the braces,
,# or:,
,do,
  ,puts, ,'Hello, World!',

,
,A code block can be passed to a method as an optional block argument. Many built-in methods have such arguments:
,
,File,.,open,(,'file.txt',,, ,'w',), ,do, ,|,file,|, ,# 'w' denotes ""write mode"",
  ,file,.,puts, ,'Wrote some text.',
,end,                                  ,# file is automatically closed here,

,File,.,readlines,(,'file.txt',),.,each, ,do, ,|,line,|,
  ,puts, ,line,
,end,
,# => Wrote some text.,
,
,Parameter-passing a block to be a ,closure,:
,
,# In an object instance variable (denoted with '@'), remember a block.,
,def, ,remember,(,&,a_block,),
  ,@block, ,=, ,a_block,
,end,

,# Invoke the preceding method, giving it a block that takes a name.,
,remember, ,{,|,name,|, ,puts, ,""Hello, ,#{,name,},!"",},

,# Call the closure (note that this happens not to close over any free variables):,
,@block,.,call,(,'Jon',),   ,# => ""Hello, Jon!"",
,
,Creating an ,anonymous function,:
,
,proc, ,{,|,arg,|, ,puts, ,arg,},
,Proc,.,new, ,{,|,arg,|, ,puts, ,arg,},
,lambda, ,{,|,arg,|, ,puts, ,arg,},
,->,(,arg,), ,{,puts, ,arg,},         ,# introduced in Ruby 1.9,
,
,Returning ,closures, from a method:

,setter,,, ,getter, ,=, ,create_set_and_get,  ,# returns two values,
,setter,.,call,(,21,),
,getter,.,call,      ,# => 21,

,# Parameter variables can also be used as a binding for the closure,,
,# so the preceding can be rewritten as:,

,def, ,create_set_and_get,(,closure_value,=,0,),
  ,[, ,proc, ,{,|,x,|, ,closure_value, ,=, ,x, ,}, ,,, ,proc, ,{, ,closure_value, ,}, ,],

,Yielding the flow of program control to a block that was provided at calling time:

,# prints:,
,# 1,
,# 'hi',
,# 3.14,

,array,.,each_index, ,{,|,index,|, ,puts, ,"",#{,index,},: ,#{,array,[,index,],},"", ,},
,# prints:,
,# 0: 1,

,# 2: 3.14,

,# The following uses a (a..b) Range,
,(,3,..,6,),.,each, ,{,|,num,|, ,puts, ,num, ,},
,# prints:,
,# 3,

,# The following uses a (a...b) Range,
,(,3,...,6,),.,each, ,{,|,num,|, ,puts, ,num, ,},
,# prints:,
,# 3,
,# 4,
,# 5,
,
,A method such as ,inject, can accept both a parameter and a block. The ,inject, method iterates over each member of a list, performing some function on it while retaining an aggregate. This is analogous to the ,foldl, function in ,functional programming languages,. For example:
,
,[,1,,,3,,,5,].,inject,(,10,), ,{,|,sum,,, ,element,|, ,sum, ,+, ,element,},   ,# => 19,
,
,On the first pass, the block receives 10 (the argument to inject) as ,sum,, and 1 (the first element of the array) as ,element,. This returns 11, which then becomes ,sum, on the next pass. It is added to 3 to get 14, which is then added to 5 on the third pass, to finally return 19.
,Using an enumeration and a block to square the numbers 1 to 10 (using a ,range,):
,
,(,1,..,10,),.,collect, ,{,|,x,|, ,x,*,x,},  ,# => [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100],
,
,Or invoke a method on each item (,map, is a synonym for ,collect,):
,
,(,1,..,5,),.,map,(,&,:to_f,),  ,# => [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
,
,Classes,[,edit,],
,The following code defines a class named ,Person,. In addition to ,initialize,, the usual constructor to create new objects, it has two methods: one to override the ,<=>, comparison operator (so ,Array#sort, can sort by age) and the other to override the ,to_s, method (so ,Kernel#puts, can format its output). Here, ,attr_reader, is an example of metaprogramming in Ruby: ,attr_accessor, defines getter and setter methods of instance variables, but ,attr_reader, only getter methods. The last evaluated statement in a method is its return value, allowing the omission of an explicit ,return, statement.
,
,class, ,Person,
  ,attr_reader, ,:name,,, ,:age,
  ,def, ,initialize,(,name,,, ,age,),
    ,@name,,, ,@age, ,=, ,name,,, ,age,
  ,end,
  ,def, ,<=>,(,person,), ,# the comparison operator for sorting,
    ,@age, ,<=>, ,person,.,age,
  ,end,
  ,def, ,to_s,
    ,"",#{,@name,}, (,#{,@age,},)"",
  ,end,
,end,

,group, ,=, ,[,
  ,Person,.,new,(,""Bob"",,, ,33,),,
  ,Person,.,new,(,""Chris"",,, ,16,),,
  ,Person,.,new,(,""Ash"",,, ,23,),
,],

,puts, ,group,.,sort,.,reverse,
,
,The preceding code prints three names in reverse age order:
,
,Bob (33)
Ash (23)
Chris (16)
,
,Person, is a constant and is a reference to a ,Class, object.
,
,Open classes,[,edit,],
,In Ruby, classes are never closed: methods can always be added to an existing class. This applies to ,all, classes, including the standard, built-in classes. All that is needed to do is open up a class definition for an existing class, and the new contents specified will be added to the existing contents. A simple example of adding a new method to the standard library's ,Time, class:
,
,# re-open Ruby's Time class,
,class, ,Time,
  ,def, ,yesterday,
    ,self, ,-, ,86400,
  ,end,
,end,

,today, ,=, ,Time,.,now,               ,# => 2013-09-03 16:09:37 +0300,
,yesterday, ,=, ,today,.,yesterday,    ,# => 2013-09-02 16:09:37 +0300,
,
,Adding methods to previously defined classes is often called ,monkey-patching,. If performed recklessly, the practice can lead to both behavior collisions with subsequent unexpected results and code scalability problems.
,Since Ruby 2.0 it has been possible to use ,refinements, to reduce the potentially negative consequences of monkey-patching, by limiting the scope of the patch to particular areas of the code base.
,
,# re-open Ruby's Time class,
,module, ,RelativeTimeExtensions,
  ,refine, ,Time, ,do,
    ,def, ,half_a_day_ago,
      ,self, ,-, ,43200,
    ,end,
  ,end,
,end,

,module, ,MyModule,
  ,class, ,MyClass,
    ,# Allow the refinement to be used,
    ,using, ,RelativeTimeExtensions,

    ,def, ,window,
      ,Time,.,now,.,half_a_day_ago,
    ,end,
  ,end,
,end,
,
,Exceptions,[,edit,],
,An exception is raised with a ,raise, call:
,
,raise,
,
,An optional message can be added to the exception:
,
,raise, ,""This is a message"",
,
,Exceptions can also be specified by the programmer:
,
,raise, ,ArgumentError,,, ,""Illegal arguments!"",
,
,Alternatively, an exception instance can be passed to the ,raise, method:
,
,raise, ,ArgumentError,.,new,(,""Illegal arguments!"",),
,
,This last construct is useful when raising an instance of a custom exception class featuring a constructor that takes more than one argument:
,
,class, ,ParseError, ,<, ,Exception,
  ,def, ,initialize,(,input,,, ,line,,, ,pos,),
    ,super, ,""Could not parse ',#{,input,},' at line ,#{,line,},, position ,#{,pos,},"",
  ,end,
,end,

,raise, ,ParseError,.,new,(,""Foo"",,, ,3,,, ,9,),
,
,Exceptions are handled by the ,rescue, clause. Such a clause can catch exceptions that inherit from ,StandardError,. Other flow control keywords that can be used when handling exceptions are ,else, and ,ensure,:
,
,begin,
  ,# do something,
,rescue,
  ,# handle exception,
,else,
  ,# do this if no exception was raised,
,ensure,
  ,# do this whether or not an exception was raised,
,end,
,
,It is a common mistake to attempt to catch all exceptions with a simple rescue clause. To catch all exceptions one must write:
,
,begin,
  ,# do something,
,rescue, ,Exception,
  ,# Exception handling code here.,
  ,# Don't write only ""rescue""; that only catches StandardError, a subclass of Exception.,
,end,
,
,Or catch particular exceptions:
,
,begin,
  ,# do something,
,rescue, ,RuntimeError,
  ,# handle only RuntimeError and its subclasses,
,end,
,
,It is also possible to specify that the exception object be made available to the handler clause:
,
,begin,
  ,# do something,
,rescue, ,RuntimeError, ,=>, ,e,
  ,# handling, possibly involving e, such as ""puts e.to_s"",
,end,
,
,Alternatively, the most recent exception is stored in the magic global ,$!,.
,Several exceptions can also be caught:
,
,begin,
  ,# do something,
,rescue, ,RuntimeError,,, ,Timeout,::,Error, ,=>, ,e,
  ,# handling, possibly involving e,
,end,

,Metaprogramming,[,edit,],
,This section ,needs additional citations for ,verification,., Please help ,improve this article, by ,adding citations to reliable sources,. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.,Find sources:, ,""Ruby"" programming language, – ,news, ,·, ,newspapers, ,·, ,books, ,·, ,scholar, ,·, ,JSTOR,  ,(,January 2014,), (,Learn how and when to remove this template message,),
,Ruby code can programmatically modify, at ,runtime,, aspects of its own structure that would be fixed in more rigid languages, such as class and method definitions. This sort of ,metaprogramming, can be used to write more concise code and effectively extend the language.
,For example, the following Ruby code generates new methods for the built-in ,String, class, based on a list of colors. The methods wrap the contents of the string with an HTML tag styled with the respective color.
,
,COLORS, ,=, ,{, ,black,:,   ,""000"",,,
           ,red,:,     ,""f00"",,,
           ,green,:,   ,""0f0"",,,
           ,yellow,:,  ,""ff0"",,,
           ,blue,:,    ,""00f"",,,
           ,magenta,:, ,""f0f"",,,
           ,cyan,:,    ,""0ff"",,,
           ,white,:,   ,""fff"", ,},

,class, ,String,
  ,COLORS,.,each, ,do, ,|,color,,,code,|,
    ,define_method, ,""in_,#{,color,},"", ,do,
      ,""<span style=,\"",color: #,#{,code,},\"",>,#{,self,},</span>"",
    ,end,
  ,end,
,end,
,
,The generated methods could then be used like this:
,
,""Hello, World!"",.,in_blue,
 ,=>, ,""<span style=,\"",color: #00f,\"",>Hello, World!</span>"",
,
,To implement the equivalent in many other languages, the programmer would have to write each method (,in_black,, ,in_red,, ,in_green,, etc.) separately.
,Some other possible uses for Ruby metaprogramming include:
,
,intercepting and modifying method calls,
,implementing new inheritance models,
,dynamically generating classes from parameters,
,automatic object serialization,
,interactive help and debugging,
,Implementations,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Ruby MRI § Operating systems,
,Matz's Ruby interpreter,[,edit,],
,The original Ruby ,interpreter, is often referred to as ,Matz's Ruby Interpreter, or MRI. This implementation is written in C and uses its own Ruby-specific ,virtual machine,.
,The standardized and retired Ruby 1.8 ,implementation, was written in ,C,, as a single-pass ,interpreted language,.,[27],
,Starting with Ruby 1.9, and continuing with Ruby 2.x and above, the official Ruby interpreter has been ,YARV, (""Yet Another Ruby VM""), and this implementation has superseded the slower virtual machine used in previous releases of MRI.
,
,Alternate implementations,[,edit,],
,As of 2018,[update],, there are a number of alternative implementations of Ruby, including ,JRuby,, ,Rubinius,, and ,mruby,. Each takes a different approach, with JRuby and Rubinius providing ,just-in-time compilation, and mruby also providing ,ahead-of-time compilation,.
,Ruby has three major alternate implementations:
,
,JRuby,, a mixed ,Java, and Ruby implementation that runs on the ,Java virtual machine,. JRuby currently targets Ruby 2.5.,
,TruffleRuby,, a Java implementation using the Truffle language implementation framework with ,GraalVM,
,Rubinius,, a ,C++, bytecode virtual machine that uses ,LLVM, to compile to machine code at runtime. The bytecode compiler and most core classes are written in pure Ruby. Rubinius currently targets Ruby 2.3.1.,
,Other Ruby implementations include:
,
,MagLev,, a ,Smalltalk, implementation that runs on ,GemTalk Systems,' ,GemStone/S, VM,
,mruby,, an implementation designed to be embedded into C code, in a similar vein to ,Lua,. It is currently being developed by ,Yukihiro Matsumoto, and others,
,RGSS, or Ruby Game Scripting System, a ,proprietary, implementation that is used by the ,RPG Maker, series of software for game design and modification of the RPG Maker engine,
,A ,transpiler, (partial) from Ruby to ,Julia,, ,julializer, is available. It can be used for a large speedup over e.g. Ruby or JRuby implementations (may only be useful for numerical code).,[103],
,Topaz,, a Ruby implementation written in ,Python,
,Opal,, a web-based interpreter that compiles Ruby to ,JavaScript,
,Other now defunct Ruby implementations were:
,
,MacRuby,, a ,Mac OS X, implementation on the ,Objective-C, runtime. Its iOS counterpart is called ,RubyMotion,
,IronRuby, an implementation on the ,.NET Framework,
,Cardinal, an implementation for the ,Parrot virtual machine,
,Ruby Enterprise Edition,, often shortened to ,ree,, an implementation optimized to handle large-scale ,Ruby on Rails, projects,
,HotRuby,, a ,JavaScript, and ,ActionScript, implementation of the ,Ruby programming language,
,The maturity of Ruby implementations tends to be measured by their ability to run the ,Ruby on Rails, (Rails) framework, because it is complex to implement and uses many Ruby-specific features. The point when a particular implementation achieves this goal is called ""the Rails singularity"". The reference implementation, JRuby, and Rubinius,[104], are all able to run Rails unmodified in a production environment.
,
,Platform support,[,edit,],
,Matsumoto originally did Ruby development on the ,4.3BSD,-based ,Sony NEWS-OS, 3.x, but later migrated his work to ,SunOS, 4.x, and finally to ,Linux,.,[105],[106],
,By 1999, Ruby was known to work across many different ,operating systems,, including NEWS-OS, SunOS, ,AIX,, ,SVR4,, ,Solaris,, ,NEC, ,UP-UX,, ,NeXTSTEP,, BSD, Linux, ,Mac OS,, ,DOS,, ,Windows,, and ,BeOS,.,[107],
,Modern Ruby versions and implementations are available on many operating systems, such as Linux, BSD, Solaris, AIX, ,macOS,, Windows, ,Windows Phone,,,[108], ,Windows CE,, ,Symbian OS,, BeOS, and ,IBM i,.
,Ruby programming language is supported across a number of cloud hosting platforms like ,Jelastic,, ,Heroku,, ,Google Cloud Platform, and others.
,
,Repositories and libraries,[,edit,],
,RubyGems, is Ruby's package manager. A Ruby package is called a ""gem"" and can easily be installed via the command line. Most gems are libraries, though a few exist that are applications, such as ,IDEs,.,[109], There are over 10,000 Ruby gems hosted on ,RubyGems.org,.
,Many new and existing Ruby libraries are hosted on ,GitHub,, a service that offers ,version control, repository hosting for ,Git,.
,The Ruby Application Archive, which hosted applications, documentation, and libraries for Ruby programming, was maintained until 2013, when its function was transferred to RubyGems.,[110],

,History,[,edit,],
,AngelList,[,edit,],
,AngelList was founded in 2010 by ,serial entrepreneur, ,Naval Ravikant, and Babak Nivi. Using the traction from the Venture Hack blog on entrepreneur financing, ,Naval, and Babak started a list of 25 investors with whom they would share interesting companies to invest in.,[1], They announced the list as “AngelList” in 2010, with the subscription of 50 ,angel investors, who intended to invest USD $80 million that year.,[7],[8],
,
,Mission & Operations,[,edit,],
,AngelList aims to democratize the investment process. ,Business Insider, dubbed AngelList the “,Match.com, for investors and startups”.,[9], In a recent interview, ,Naval Ravikant, wants more “innovation on [the] infrastructure for innovation itself” by helping startups with money, talent, and customers.,[10],
,AngelList's Syndicate facilitates startup financing with ,accredited investors,. AngelList Jobs connect talents with startups, with over 35,000 recruiting companies, more than 2,000,000 candidates and 5 million registered users.,[11],[12], AngelList's acquisition of ,Product Hunt, will allow more support for startups with customer generation and product launch.,[13],[14],[11], AngelList Syndicates allow startups to raise money from accredited investors investing alongside prominent angel investors.,[15],[16],[17],[18],[19],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,AngelList launched Jobs - its recruiting portal in 2012.,[20],[21],
,In late 2012, AngelList launched a portal for accelerators and incubators to accept and manage applications from startups to their programs.,[22], At opening, AngelList accepted applications for ,500 Startups,, ,TechStars, Boston, and ,AngelPad,. Other accelerators, like ,Rock Health,, accept applications exclusively through AngelList.,[1],[23],[24],
,In 2013, AngelList received a no-action letter from the SEC, allowing the operations of its Syndicates platform. FundersClub also received such a letter in the same period.,[25],[26], AngelList Syndicates was noted as one of the most important innovations in the venture capital and angel investment industries, getting momentum with several well-known figures in the tech community creating syndicates, including ,Jason Calacanis,, ,Scott Banister,, ,Tim Ferriss,, ,Gil Penchina,, ,Scott, and ,Cyan Banister,, ,Fabrice Grinda,, Elad Gil and more.,[27],[28], In 2017, AngelList had 4,400 investors operating across 165 syndicates.
,In March 2014, AngelList launched Maiden Lane, a first online venture fund for investing in syndicated deals.,[27], It was launched with more than $25 million in funding from a variety of investors.,[29],[30],[31], 
,In October 2015, AngelList announced a deal with a Chinese third-largest private equity firm CSC (China Science & Merchants Investment Management Group) for establishing a new $400 million fund for early-stage startup investments.,[32],[33], According to ,The Wall Street Journal,, the deal became the “largest single pool of funds devoted to early-stage startups — ever,” and also the “largest-ever single investment by a Chinese private-equity firm in a U.S. fund.”,[32],[33],
,Prior to the deal, according to ,TWSJ,, AngelList ""had raised $205 million from all sources, including $43 million from institutional investors."",[33],
,In July 2016, AngelList launched Republic - a spinoff addressing the democratization of startup equity crowdfunding with non-accredited investors.,[34],[10],
,In November 2016, AngelList acquired ,Product Hunt, for $20 million.,[13],[14],[11], ,Naval Ravikant, plans to build Product Hunt further in “helping companies find their early customers.”,[10],
,In October 2017, CoinList - ,initial coin offering, services for startups and accredited investors - spun off from AngelList.,[35], At the end of 2017 AngelList had profiles of over 70,000 startups.,[36],
,
,Involvement in the JOBS Act,[,edit,],
,In mid-2012, ,Naval Ravikant, and Kevin Laws, AngelList's chief operating officer,,[37], were active in Washington in his support for the ,Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, (JOBS Act), a law that eased many of the United States' securities regulations with the aim of making it easier for companies to either go ,public, or to remain ,private, longer while continuing to raise capital.,[38],[7],[39], He was in discussion with “Senate and Congressional staffers, Steve Case, and influential Congressmen who would listen.”,[40], During the same period, he organized an online petition that attracted 5,000 signatures on a letter to Senate leaders in support of the Act.,[7],[41], Later in 2013, ,Naval Ravikant, wrote a letter to the SEC to object changes in the JOBS Act that he believed ""could create disastrous unintended consequences for the startup community."",[42],

,In ,computing,, a ,file system, or ,filesystem, (often abbreviated to ,fs,), controls how data is ,stored, and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified. Taking its name from the way paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a "",file,"". The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a ""file system"".
,There are many different kinds of file systems. Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, size and more. Some file systems have been designed to be used for specific applications. For example, the ,ISO 9660, file system is designed specifically for ,optical discs,.
,File systems can be used on numerous different types of ,storage devices, that use different kinds of media. As of 2019, ,hard disk drives, have been key storage devices and are projected to remain so for the foreseeable future.,[1], Other kinds of media that are used include ,SSDs,, ,magnetic tapes,, and optical discs. In some cases, such as with ,tmpfs,, the computer's main memory (,random-access memory,, RAM) is used to create a temporary file system for short-term use.
,
Some file systems are used on local ,data storage devices,;,[2], others provide file access via a ,network protocol, (for example, ,NFS,,,[3], ,SMB,, or ,9P, clients).  Some file systems are ""virtual"", meaning that the supplied ""files"" (called ,virtual files,) are computed on request (such as ,procfs, and ,sysfs,) or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store.  The file system manages access to both the content of files and the ,metadata, about those files.  It is responsible for arranging storage space; reliability, efficiency, and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations.

,Origin of the term,[,edit,],
,Before the advent of computers the term ,file system, was used to describe a method of storing and retrieving paper documents.,[4], By 1961 the term was being applied to computerized filing alongside the original meaning.,[5], By 1964 it was in general use.,[6],
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,A file system consists of two or three layers. Sometimes the layers are explicitly separated, and sometimes the functions are combined.,[7],
,The ,logical file system, is responsible for interaction with the user application. It provides the ,application program interface, (API) for file operations — ,OPEN,, ,CLOSE,, ,READ,, etc., and passes the requested operation to the layer below it for processing. The logical file system ""manage[s] open file table entries and per-process file descriptors."",[8], This layer provides ""file access, directory operations, [and] security and protection."",[7],
,The second optional layer is the ,virtual file system,. ""This interface allows support for multiple concurrent instances of physical file systems, each of which is called a file system implementation."",[8],
,The third layer is the ,physical file system,. This layer is concerned with the physical operation of the storage device (e.g. disk). It processes physical ,blocks, being read or written. It handles ,buffering, and ,memory management, and is responsible for the physical placement of blocks in specific locations on the storage medium.  The physical file system interacts with the ,device drivers, or with the ,channel, to drive the storage device.,[7],
,
,Aspects of file systems,[,edit,],
,Space management,[,edit,],
,Note: this only applies to file systems used in storage devices.,
,
,  ,An example of slack space, demonstrated with 4,096-,byte, NTFS clusters: 100,000 files, each five bytes per file, which equal to 500,000 bytes of actual data but require 409,600,000 bytes of disk space to store,
,File systems allocate space in a granular manner, usually multiple physical units on the device. The file system is responsible for organizing ,files, and ,directories,, and keeping track of which areas of the media belong to which file and which are not being used. For example, in ,Apple DOS, of the early 1980s, 256-byte sectors on 140 kilobyte floppy disk used a ,track/sector map,.,[,citation needed,],
,This results in unused space when a file is not an exact multiple of the allocation unit, sometimes referred to as ,slack space,. For a 512-byte allocation, the average unused space is 256 bytes. For 64 KB clusters, the average unused space is 32 KB. The size of the allocation unit is chosen when the file system is created. Choosing the allocation size based on the average size of the files expected to be in the file system can minimize the amount of unusable space. Frequently the default allocation may provide reasonable usage. Choosing an allocation size that is too small results in excessive overhead if the file system will contain mostly very large files.
,
,  ,File systems may become ,fragmented,
,File system fragmentation, occurs when unused space or single files are not contiguous. As a file system is used, files are created, modified and deleted. When a file is created the file system allocates space for the data. Some file systems permit or require specifying an initial space allocation and subsequent incremental allocations as the file grows. As files are deleted the space they were allocated eventually is considered available for use by other files. This creates alternating used and unused areas of various sizes. This is free space fragmentation. When a file is created and there is not an area of contiguous space available for its initial allocation the space must be assigned in fragments. When a file is modified such that it becomes larger it may exceed the space initially allocated to it, another allocation must be assigned elsewhere and the file becomes fragmented.
,In some operating systems a system administrator may use ,disk quotas, to limit the allocation of disk space.
,
,Filenames,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Filename,
,A ,filename, (or ,file name,) is used to identify a storage location in the file system. Most file systems have restrictions on the length of filenames. In some file systems, filenames are not ,case sensitive, (i.e., the names ,MYFILE, and ,myfile, refer to the same file in a directory); in others, filenames are case sensitive (i.e., the names ,MYFILE,, ,MyFile,, and ,myfile, refer to three separate files that are in the same directory).
,Most modern file systems allow filenames to contain a wide range of characters from the ,Unicode, character set. However, they may have restrictions on the use of certain special characters, disallowing them within filenames; those characters might be used to indicate a device, device type, directory prefix, file path separator, or file type.
,
,Directories,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Directory (file systems),
,File systems typically have ,directories, (also called ,folders,) which allow the user to group files into separate collections. This may be implemented by associating the file name with an index in a ,table of contents, or an ,inode, in a ,Unix-like, file system. Directory structures may be flat (i.e. linear), or allow hierarchies where directories may contain subdirectories. The first file system to support arbitrary hierarchies of directories was used in the ,Multics, operating system.,[9], The native file systems of Unix-like systems also support arbitrary directory hierarchies, as do, for example, ,Apple,'s ,Hierarchical File System,, and its successor ,HFS+, in ,classic Mac OS,, the ,FAT, file system in ,MS-DOS, 2.0 and later versions of MS-DOS and in ,Microsoft Windows,, the ,NTFS, file system in the ,Windows NT, family of operating systems, and the ODS-2 (On-Disk Structure-2) and higher levels of the ,Files-11, file system in ,OpenVMS,.
,
,Metadata,[,edit,],
,Other bookkeeping information is typically associated with each file within a file system. The ,length, of the data contained in a file may be stored as the number of blocks allocated for the file or as a ,byte, count. The ,time, that the file was last modified may be stored as the file's timestamp. File systems might store the file creation time, the time it was last accessed, the time the file's ,metadata, was changed, or the time the file was last backed up. Other information can include the file's ,device type, (e.g. ,block,, ,character,, ,socket,, ,subdirectory,, etc.), its owner ,user ID, and ,group ID,, its ,access permissions, and other ,file attributes, (e.g. whether the file is read-only, ,executable,, etc.).
,A file system stores all the metadata associated with the file—including the file name, the length of the contents of a file, and the location of the file in the folder hierarchy—separate from the contents of the file.
,Most file systems store the names of all the files in one directory in one place—the directory table for that directory—which is often stored like any other file.
Many file systems put only some of the metadata for a file in the directory table, and the rest of the metadata for that file in a completely separate structure, such as the ,inode,.
,Most file systems also store metadata not associated with any one particular file.
Such metadata includes information about unused regions—,free space bitmap,, ,block availability map,—and information about ,bad sectors,.
Often such information about an ,allocation group, is stored inside the allocation group itself.
,Additional attributes can be associated on file systems, such as ,NTFS,, ,XFS,, ,ext2,, ,ext3,, some versions of ,UFS,, and ,HFS+,, using ,extended file attributes,. Some file systems provide for user defined attributes such as the author of the document, the character encoding of a document or the size of an image.
,Some file systems allow for different data collections to be associated with one file name. These separate collections may be referred to as ,streams, or ,forks,. Apple has long used a forked file system on the Macintosh, and Microsoft supports streams in NTFS. Some file systems maintain multiple past revisions of a file under a single file name; the filename by itself retrieves the most recent version, while prior saved version can be accessed using a special naming convention such as ""filename;4"" or ""filename(-4)"" to access the version four saves ago.
,See ,comparison of file systems#Metadata, for details on which file systems support which kinds of metadata.
,
,File system as an abstract user interface,[,edit,],
,In some cases, a file system may not make use of a storage device but can be used to organize and represent access to any data, whether it is stored or dynamically generated (e.g. ,procfs,).
,
,Utilities,[,edit,],
,File systems include utilities to initialize, alter parameters of and remove an instance of the file system. Some include the ability to extend or truncate the space allocated to the file system.
,
Directory utilities may be used to create, rename and delete ,directory entries,, which are also known as ,dentries, (singular: ,dentry,),,[10], and to alter metadata associated with a directory. Directory utilities may also include capabilities to create additional links to a directory (,hard links, in ,Unix,), to rename parent links ("".."" in ,Unix-like, operating systems),,[,clarification needed,], and to create bidirectional links to files.
,File utilities create, list, copy, move and delete files, and alter metadata. They may be able to truncate data, truncate or extend space allocation, append to, move, and modify files in-place. Depending on the underlying structure of the file system, they may provide a mechanism to prepend to or truncate from, the beginning of a file, insert entries into the middle of a file or delete entries from a file.
,Utilities to free space for deleted files, if the file system provides an undelete function, also belong to this category.
,Some file systems defer operations such as reorganization of free space, secure erasing of free space, and rebuilding of hierarchical structures by providing utilities to perform these functions at times of minimal activity. An example is the file system ,defragmentation, utilities.
,Some of the most important features of file system utilities involve supervisory activities which may involve bypassing ownership or direct access to the underlying device. These include high-performance backup and recovery, data replication and reorganization of various data structures and allocation tables within the file system.
,
,Restricting and permitting access,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Computer security,, ,Password cracking,, ,Filesystem-level encryption,, and ,Encrypting File System,
,There are several mechanisms used by file systems to control access to data. Usually the intent is to prevent reading or modifying files by a user or group of users. Another reason is to ensure data is modified in a controlled way so access may be restricted to a specific program. Examples include passwords stored in the metadata of the file or elsewhere and ,file permissions, in the form of permission bits, ,access control lists,, or ,capabilities,. The need for file system utilities to be able to access the data at the media level to reorganize the structures and provide efficient backup usually means that these are only effective for polite users but are not effective against intruders.
,Methods for encrypting file data are sometimes included in the file system. This is very effective since there is no need for file system utilities to know the encryption seed to effectively manage the data. The risks of relying on encryption include the fact that an attacker can copy the data and use brute force to decrypt the data. Losing the seed means losing the data.
,
,Maintaining integrity,[,edit,],
,One significant responsibility of a file system is to ensure that, regardless of the actions by programs accessing the data, the structure remains consistent. This includes actions taken if a program modifying data terminates abnormally or neglects to inform the file system that it has completed its activities. This may include updating the metadata, the directory entry and handling any data that was buffered but not yet updated on the physical storage media.
,Other failures which the file system must deal with include media failures or loss of connection to remote systems.
,In the event of an operating system failure or ""soft"" power failure, special routines in the file system must be invoked similar to when an individual program fails.
,The file system must also be able to correct damaged structures. These may occur as a result of an operating system failure for which the OS was unable to notify the file system, power failure or reset.
,The file system must also record events to allow analysis of systemic issues as well as problems with specific files or directories.
,
,User data,[,edit,],
,The most important purpose of a file system is to manage user data. This includes storing, retrieving and updating data.
,Some file systems accept data for storage as a stream of bytes which are collected and stored in a manner efficient for the media. When a program retrieves the data, it specifies the size of a memory buffer and the file system transfers data from the media to the buffer. A runtime library routine may sometimes allow the user program to define a ,record, based on a library call specifying a length. When the user program reads the data, the library retrieves data via the file system and returns a ,record,.
,Some file systems allow the specification of a fixed record length which is used for all writes and reads. This facilitates locating the n,th, record as well as updating records.
,An identification for each record, also known as a key, makes for a more sophisticated file system. The user program can read, write and update records without regard to their location. This requires complicated management of blocks of media usually separating key blocks and data blocks. Very efficient algorithms can be developed with pyramid structure for locating records.,[11],
,
,Using a file system,[,edit,],
,Utilities, language specific run-time libraries and user programs use ,file system APIs, to make requests of the file system. These include data transfer, positioning, updating metadata, managing directories, managing access specifications, and removal.
,
,Multiple file systems within a single system,[,edit,],
,Frequently, retail systems are configured with a single file system occupying the entire ,storage device,.
,Another approach is to ,partition, the disk so that several file systems with different attributes can be used. One file system, for use as browser cache, might be configured with a small allocation size. This has the additional advantage of keeping the frantic activity of creating and deleting files typical of browser activity in a narrow area of the disk and not interfering with allocations of other files. A similar partition might be created for email. Another partition, and file system might be created for the storage of audio or video files with a relatively large allocation. One of the file systems may normally be set ,read-only, and only periodically be set writable.
,A third approach, which is mostly used in cloud systems, is to use "",disk images,"" to house additional file systems, with the same attributes or not, within another (host) file system as a file. A common example is virtualization: one user can run an experimental Linux distribution (using the ,ext4, file system) in a virtual machine under his/her production Windows environment (using ,NTFS,). The ext4 file system resides in a disk image, which is treated as a file (or multiple files, depending on the hypervisor and settings) in the NTFS host file system.
,Having multiple file systems on a single system has the additional benefit that in the event of a corruption of a single partition, the remaining file systems will frequently still be intact. This includes virus destruction of the ,system, partition or even a system that will not boot. File system utilities which require dedicated access can be effectively completed piecemeal. In addition, ,defragmentation, may be more effective. Several system maintenance utilities, such as virus scans and backups, can also be processed in segments. For example, it is not necessary to backup the file system containing videos along with all the other files if none have been added since the last backup. As for the image files, one can easily ""spin off"" differential images which contain only ""new"" data written to the master (original) image. Differential images can be used for both safety concerns (as a ""disposable"" system - can be quickly restored if destroyed or contaminated by a virus, as the old image can be removed and a new image can be created in matter of seconds, even without automated procedures) and quick virtual machine deployment (since the differential images can be quickly spawned using a script in batches).
,
,Design limitations,[,edit,],
,All file systems have some functional limit that defines the maximum storable data capacity within that system,[,citation needed,],. These functional limits are a best-guess effort by the designer based on how large the storage systems are right now and how large storage systems are likely to become in the future. Disk storage has continued to increase at near ,exponential, rates (see ,Moore's law,), so after a few years, file systems have kept reaching design limitations that require computer users to repeatedly move to a newer system with ever-greater capacity.
,File system complexity typically varies proportionally with the available storage capacity. The file systems of early 1980s ,home computers, with 50 KB to 512 KB of storage would not be a reasonable choice for modern storage systems with hundreds of gigabytes of capacity. Likewise, modern file systems would not be a reasonable choice for these early systems, since the complexity of modern file system structures would quickly consume or even exceed the very limited capacity of the early storage systems.
,
,Types of file systems,[,edit,],
,File system types can be classified into disk/tape file systems, network file systems and special-purpose file systems.
,
,Disk file systems,[,edit,],
,A ,disk file system, takes advantages of the ability of disk storage media to randomly address data in a short amount of time. Additional considerations include the speed of accessing data following that initially requested and the anticipation that the following data may also be requested. This permits multiple users (or processes) access to various data on the disk without regard to the sequential location of the data. Examples include ,FAT, (,FAT12,, ,FAT16,, ,FAT32,), ,exFAT,, ,NTFS,, ,HFS, and ,HFS+,, ,HPFS,, ,APFS,, ,UFS,, ,ext2,, ,ext3,, ,ext4,, ,XFS,, ,btrfs,, ,Files-11,, ,Veritas File System,, ,VMFS,, ,ZFS,, and ,ReiserFS,. Some disk file systems are ,journaling file systems, or ,versioning file systems,.
,
,Optical discs,[,edit,],
,ISO 9660, and ,Universal Disk Format, (UDF) are two common formats that target ,Compact Discs,, ,DVDs, and ,Blu-ray, discs. ,Mount Rainier, is an extension to UDF supported since 2.6 series of the Linux kernel and since Windows Vista that facilitates rewriting to DVDs.
,
,Flash file systems,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Flash file system,
,A ,flash file system, considers the special abilities, performance and restrictions of ,flash memory, devices. Frequently a disk file system can use a flash memory device as the underlying storage media but it is much better to use a file system specifically designed for a flash device.
,
,Tape file systems,[,edit,],
,A ,tape file system, is a file system and tape format designed to store files on tape in a self-describing form,[,clarification needed,],. ,Magnetic tapes, are sequential storage media with significantly longer random data access times than disks, posing challenges to the creation and efficient management of a general-purpose file system.
,In a disk file system there is typically a master file directory, and a map of used and free data regions. Any file additions, changes, or removals require updating the directory and the used/free maps. Random access to data regions is measured in milliseconds so this system works well for disks.
,Tape requires linear motion to wind and unwind potentially very long reels of media. This tape motion may take several seconds to several minutes to move the read/write head from one end of the tape to the other.
,Consequently, a master file directory and usage map can be extremely slow and inefficient with tape. Writing typically involves reading the block usage map to find free blocks for writing, updating the usage map and directory to add the data, and then advancing the tape to write the data in the correct spot. Each additional file write requires updating the map and directory and writing the data, which may take several seconds to occur for each file.
,Tape file systems instead typically allow for the file directory to be spread across the tape intermixed with the data, referred to as ,streaming,, so that time-consuming and repeated tape motions are not required to write new data.
,However, a side effect of this design is that reading the file directory of a tape usually requires scanning the entire tape to read all the scattered directory entries. Most data archiving software that works with tape storage will store a local copy of the tape catalog on a disk file system, so that adding files to a tape can be done quickly without having to rescan the tape media. The local tape catalog copy is usually discarded if not used for a specified period of time, at which point the tape must be re-scanned if it is to be used in the future.
,IBM has developed a file system for tape called the ,Linear Tape File System,. The IBM implementation of this file system has been released as the open-source ,IBM Linear Tape File System — Single Drive Edition (LTFS-SDE), product. The Linear Tape File System uses a separate partition on the tape to record the index meta-data, thereby avoiding the problems associated with scattering directory entries across the entire tape.
,
,Tape formatting,[,edit,],
,Writing data to a tape, erasing, or formatting a tape is often a significantly time-consuming process and can take several hours on large tapes.,[a],  With many data tape technologies it is not necessary to format the tape before over-writing new data to the tape. This is due to the inherently destructive nature of overwriting data on sequential media.
,Because of the time it can take to format a tape, typically tapes are pre-formatted so that the tape user does not need to spend time preparing each new tape for use. All that is usually necessary is to write an identifying media label to the tape before use, and even this can be automatically written by software when a new tape is used for the first time.
,
,Database file systems,[,edit,],
,Another concept for file management is the idea of a database-based file system. Instead of, or in addition to, hierarchical structured management, files are identified by their characteristics, like type of file, topic, author, or similar ,rich metadata,.,[12],
,IBM DB2 for i ,[13], (formerly known as DB2/400 and DB2 for i5/OS) is a database file system as part of the object based IBM i ,[14], operating system (formerly known as OS/400 and i5/OS), incorporating a ,single level store, and running on IBM Power Systems (formerly known as AS/400 and iSeries), designed by Frank G. Soltis IBM's former chief scientist for IBM i. Around 1978 to 1988 Frank G. Soltis and his team at IBM Rochester have successfully designed and applied technologies like the database file system where others like Microsoft later failed to accomplish.,[15],  These technologies are informally known as 'Fortress Rochester',[,citation needed,], and were in few basic aspects extended from early Mainframe technologies but in many ways more advanced from a technological perspective,[,citation needed,],.
,Some other projects that aren't ""pure"" database file systems but that use some aspects of a database file system:
,
,Many ,Web content management systems, use a ,relational DBMS, to store and retrieve files. For example, ,XHTML, files are stored as ,XML, or text fields, while image files are stored as blob fields; ,SQL, SELECT (with optional ,XPath,) statements retrieve the files, and allow the use of a sophisticated logic and more rich information associations than ""usual file systems"". Many CMSs also have the option of storing only ,metadata, within the database, with the standard filesystem used to store the content of files.,
,Very large file systems, embodied by applications like ,Apache Hadoop, and ,Google File System,, use some ,database file system, concepts.,
,Transactional file systems,[,edit,],
,Some programs need to either make multiple file system changes, or, if one or more of the changes fail for any reason, make none of the changes. For example, a program which is installing or updating software may write executables, libraries, and/or configuration files. If some of the writing fails and the software is left partially installed or updated, the software may be broken or unusable. An incomplete update of a key system utility, such as the command ,shell,, may leave the entire system in an unusable state.
,Transaction processing, introduces the ,atomicity, guarantee, ensuring that operations inside of a transaction are either all committed or the transaction can be aborted and the system discards all of its partial results. This means that if there is a crash or power failure, after recovery, the stored state will be consistent. Either the software will be completely installed or the failed installation will be completely rolled back, but an unusable partial install will not be left on the system. Transactions also provide the ,isolation, guarantee,[,clarification needed,],, meaning that operations within a transaction are hidden from other threads on the system until the transaction commits, and that interfering operations on the system will be properly ,serialized, with the transaction.
,Windows, beginning with Vista, added transaction support to ,NTFS,, in a feature called ,Transactional NTFS,, but its use is now discouraged.,[16], There are a number of research prototypes of transactional file systems for UNIX systems, including the Valor file system,,[17], Amino,,[18], LFS,,[19], and a transactional ,ext3, file system on the TxOS kernel,,[20], as well as transactional file systems targeting embedded systems, such as TFFS.,[21],
,Ensuring consistency across multiple file system operations is difficult, if not impossible, without file system transactions. ,File locking, can be used as a ,concurrency control, mechanism for individual files, but it typically does not protect the directory structure or file metadata. For instance, file locking cannot prevent ,TOCTTOU, race conditions on symbolic links.
File locking also cannot automatically roll back a failed operation, such as a software upgrade; this requires atomicity.
,Journaling file systems, is one technique used to introduce transaction-level consistency to file system structures. Journal transactions are not exposed to programs as part of the OS API; they are only used internally to ensure consistency at the granularity of a single system call.
,Data backup systems typically do not provide support for direct backup of data stored in a transactional manner, which makes the recovery of reliable and consistent data sets difficult. Most backup software simply notes what files have changed since a certain time, regardless of the transactional state shared across multiple files in the overall dataset. As a workaround, some database systems simply produce an archived state file containing all data up to that point, and the backup software only backs that up and does not interact directly with the active transactional databases at all. Recovery requires separate recreation of the database from the state file after the file has been restored by the backup software.
,
,Network file systems,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Distributed file system,
,A ,network file system, is a file system that acts as a client for a remote file access protocol, providing access to files on a server.  Programs using local interfaces can transparently create, manage and access hierarchical directories and files in remote network-connected computers.  Examples of network file systems include clients for the ,NFS,, ,AFS,, ,SMB, protocols, and file-system-like clients for ,FTP, and ,WebDAV,.
,
,Shared disk file systems,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Shared disk file system,
,A ,shared disk file system, is one in which a number of machines (usually servers) all have access to the same external disk subsystem (usually a SAN). The file system arbitrates access to that subsystem, preventing write collisions. Examples include ,GFS2, from ,Red Hat,, ,GPFS, from IBM, ,SFS, from DataPlow, ,CXFS, from ,SGI, and ,StorNext, from ,Quantum Corporation,.
,
,Special file systems ,[,edit,],
,A ,special file system, presents non-file elements of an operating system as files so they can be acted on using file system APIs. This is most commonly done in ,Unix-like, operating systems, but devices are given file names in some non-Unix-like operating systems as well.
,
,Device file systems ,[,edit,],
,A ,device file system, represents I/O devices and pseudo-devices as files, called ,device files,. Examples in ,Unix-like, systems include ,devfs, and, in ,Linux, 2.6 systems, ,udev,. In non-Unix-like systems, such as ,TOPS-10, and other operating systems influenced by it, where the full filename or ,pathname, of a file can include a device prefix, devices other than those containing file systems are referred to by a device prefix specifying the device, without anything following it.
,
,Other special file systems,[,edit,],
,In the Linux kernel, ,configfs, and ,sysfs, provide files that can be used to query the kernel for information and configure entities in the kernel.,
,procfs, maps processes and, on Linux, other operating system structures into a filespace.,
,Minimal file system / audio-cassette storage,[,edit,],
,In the 1970s disk and digital tape devices were too expensive for some early ,microcomputer, users. An inexpensive basic data storage system was devised that used common ,audio cassette, tape.
,When the system needed to write data, the user was notified to press ""RECORD"" on the cassette recorder, then press ""RETURN"" on the keyboard to notify the system that the cassette recorder was recording. The system wrote a sound to provide time synchronization, then ,modulated sounds, that encoded a prefix, the data, a ,checksum, and a suffix. When the system needed to read data, the user was instructed to press ""PLAY"" on the cassette recorder. The system would ,listen, to the sounds on the tape waiting until a burst of sound could be recognized as the synchronization. The system would then interpret subsequent sounds as data. When the data read was complete, the system would notify the user to press ""STOP"" on the cassette recorder. It was primitive, but it worked (a lot of the time). Data was stored sequentially, usually in an unnamed format, although some systems (such as the ,Commodore PET, series of computers) did allow the files to be named. Multiple sets of data could be written and located by fast-forwarding the tape and observing at the tape counter to find the approximate start of the next data region on the tape. The user might have to listen to the sounds to find the right spot to begin playing the next data region. Some implementations even included audible sounds interspersed with the data.
,
,Flat file systems,[,edit,],
,Not to be confused with ,Flat file database,.,
,In a flat file system, there are no ,subdirectories,; directory entries for all files are stored in a single directory.
,When ,floppy disk, media was first available this type of file system was adequate due to the relatively small amount of data space available. ,CP/M, machines featured a flat file system, where files could be assigned to one of 16 ,user areas, and generic file operations narrowed to work on one instead of defaulting to work on all of them. These user areas were no more than special attributes associated with the files; that is, it was not necessary to define specific ,quota, for each of these areas and files could be added to groups for as long as there was still free storage space on the disk. The early ,Apple Macintosh, also featured a flat file system, the ,Macintosh File System,. It was unusual in that the file management program (,Macintosh Finder,) created the illusion of a partially hierarchical filing system on top of EMFS. This structure required every file to have a unique name, even if it appeared to be in a separate folder. ,IBM, ,DOS/360, and ,OS/360, store entries for all files on a disk pack (,volume,) in a directory on the pack called a ,Volume Table of Contents, (VTOC).
,While simple, flat file systems become awkward as the number of files grows and makes it difficult to organize data into related groups of files.
,A recent addition to the flat file system family is ,Amazon,'s ,S3,, a remote storage service, which is intentionally simplistic to allow users the ability to customize how their data is stored. The only constructs are buckets (imagine a disk drive of unlimited size) and objects (similar, but not identical to the standard concept of a file). Advanced file management is allowed by being able to use nearly any character (including '/') in the object's name, and the ability to select subsets of the bucket's content based on identical prefixes.
,
,File systems and operating systems,[,edit,],
,Many ,operating systems, include support for more than one file system. Sometimes the OS and the file system are so tightly interwoven that it is difficult to separate out file system functions.
,There needs to be an interface provided by the operating system software between the user and the file system. This interface can be textual (such as provided by a ,command line interface,, such as the ,Unix shell,, or ,OpenVMS DCL,) or graphical (such as provided by a ,graphical user interface,, such as ,file browsers,). If graphical, the metaphor of the ,folder,, containing documents, other files, and nested folders is often used (see also: ,directory, and folder).
,
,Unix and Unix-like operating systems,[,edit,],
,Unix-like, operating systems create a virtual file system, which makes all the files on all the devices appear to exist in a single hierarchy. This means, in those systems, there is one ,root directory,, and every file existing on the system is located under it somewhere. Unix-like systems can use a ,RAM disk, or network shared resource as its root directory.
,Unix-like systems assign a device name to each device, but this is not how the files on that device are accessed. Instead, to gain access to files on another device, the operating system must first be informed where in the directory tree those files should appear. This process is called ,mounting, a file system. For example, to access the files on a ,CD-ROM,, one must tell the operating system ""Take the file system from this CD-ROM and make it appear under such-and-such directory"". The directory given to the operating system is called the ,mount point, – it might, for example, be ,/media,. The ,/media, directory exists on many Unix systems (as specified in the ,Filesystem Hierarchy Standard,) and is intended specifically for use as a mount point for removable media such as CDs, DVDs, USB drives or floppy disks. It may be empty, or it may contain subdirectories for mounting individual devices. Generally, only the ,administrator, (i.e. ,root user,) may authorize the mounting of file systems.
,Unix-like, operating systems often include software and tools that assist in the mounting process and provide it new functionality. Some of these strategies have been coined ""auto-mounting"" as a reflection of their purpose.
,
,In many situations, file systems other than the root need to be available as soon as the operating system has ,booted,. All Unix-like systems therefore provide a facility for mounting file systems at boot time. ,System administrators, define these file systems in the configuration file ,fstab, (,vfstab, in ,Solaris,), which also indicates options and mount points.,
,In some situations, there is no need to mount certain file systems at ,boot time,, although their use may be desired thereafter. There are some utilities for Unix-like systems that allow the mounting of predefined file systems upon demand.,
,Removable media have become very common with ,microcomputer, platforms. They allow programs and data to be transferred between machines without a physical connection. Common examples include ,USB flash drives,, ,CD-ROMs,, and ,DVDs,. Utilities have therefore been developed to detect the presence and availability of a medium and then mount that medium without any user intervention.,
,Progressive Unix-like systems have also introduced a concept called ,supermounting,; see, for example, ,the Linux supermount-ng project,. For example, a floppy disk that has been supermounted can be physically removed from the system. Under normal circumstances, the disk should have been synchronized and then unmounted before its removal. Provided synchronization has occurred, a different disk can be inserted into the drive. The system automatically notices that the disk has changed and updates the mount point contents to reflect the new medium.,
,An ,automounter, will automatically mount a file system when a reference is made to the directory atop which it should be mounted. This is usually used for file systems on network servers, rather than relying on events such as the insertion of media, as would be appropriate for removable media.,
,Linux,[,edit,],
,Linux, supports numerous file systems, but common choices for the system disk on a block device include the ext* family (,ext2,, ,ext3, and ,ext4,), ,XFS,, ,JFS,, and ,btrfs,. For raw flash without a ,flash translation layer, (FTL) or ,Memory Technology Device, (MTD), there are ,UBIFS,, ,JFFS2, and ,YAFFS,, among others. ,SquashFS, is a common compressed read-only file system.
,
,Solaris,[,edit,],
,Solaris, in earlier releases defaulted to (non-journaled or non-logging) ,UFS, for bootable and supplementary file systems. Solaris defaulted to, supported, and extended UFS.
,Support for other file systems and significant enhancements were added over time, including ,Veritas Software, Corp. (journaling) ,VxFS,, Sun Microsystems (clustering) ,QFS,, Sun Microsystems (journaling) UFS, and Sun Microsystems (open source, poolable, 128 bit compressible, and error-correcting) ,ZFS,.
,Kernel extensions were added to Solaris to allow for bootable Veritas ,VxFS, operation. Logging or ,journaling, was added to UFS in Sun's ,Solaris 7,. Releases of ,Solaris 10,, Solaris Express, ,OpenSolaris,, and other open source variants of the Solaris operating system later supported bootable ,ZFS,.
,Logical Volume Management, allows for spanning a file system across multiple devices for the purpose of adding redundancy, capacity, and/or throughput. Legacy environments in Solaris may use ,Solaris Volume Manager, (formerly known as ,Solstice DiskSuite,). Multiple operating systems (including Solaris) may use ,Veritas Volume Manager,. Modern Solaris based operating systems eclipse the need for volume management through leveraging virtual storage pools in ,ZFS,.
,
,macOS,[,edit,],
,macOS (formerly Mac OS X), uses the ,Apple File System, (APFS), which recently replaced a file system inherited from ,classic Mac OS, called ,HFS Plus, (HFS+). Apple also uses the term ""Mac OS Extended"" for HFS+.,[22], HFS Plus is a ,metadata,-rich and ,case-preserving, but (usually) ,case-insensitive, file system. Due to the Unix roots of macOS, Unix permissions were added to HFS Plus. Later versions of HFS Plus added journaling to prevent corruption of the file system structure and introduced a number of optimizations to the allocation algorithms in an attempt to defragment files automatically without requiring an external defragmenter.
,Filenames can be up to 255 characters. HFS Plus uses ,Unicode, to store filenames. On macOS, the ,filetype, can come from the ,type code,, stored in file's metadata, or the ,filename extension,.
,HFS Plus has three kinds of links: Unix-style ,hard links,, Unix-style ,symbolic links,, and ,aliases,. Aliases are designed to maintain a link to their original file even if they are moved or renamed; they are not interpreted by the file system itself, but by the File Manager code in ,userland,.
,macOS 10.13 High Sierra, which was announced on June 5, 2017 at Apple's WWDC event, uses the ,Apple File System, on ,solid-state drives,.
,macOS also supported the ,UFS, file system, derived from the ,BSD, Unix Fast File System via ,NeXTSTEP,. However, as of ,Mac OS X Leopard,, macOS could no longer be installed on a UFS volume, nor can a pre-Leopard system installed on a UFS volume be upgraded to Leopard.,[23], As of ,Mac OS X Lion, UFS support was completely dropped.
,Newer versions of macOS are capable of reading and writing to the legacy ,FAT, file systems (16 and 32) common on Windows. They are also capable of ,reading, the newer ,NTFS, file systems for Windows. In order to ,write, to NTFS file systems on macOS versions prior to ,Mac OS X Snow Leopard, third party software is necessary. Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and later allow writing to NTFS file systems, but only after a non-trivial system setting change (third party software exists that automates this).,[24],
,Finally, macOS supports reading and writing of the ,exFAT, file system since Mac OS X Snow Leopard, starting from version 10.6.5.,[25],
,
,OS/2,[,edit,],
,OS/2, 1.2 introduced the ,High Performance File System, (HPFS). HPFS supports mixed case file names in different ,code pages,, long file names (255 characters), more efficient use of disk space, an architecture that keeps related items close to each other on the disk volume, less fragmentation of data, ,extent-based, space allocation, a ,B+ tree, structure for directories, and the root directory located at the midpoint of the disk, for faster average access. A ,journaled filesystem, (JFS) was shipped in 1999.
,
,PC-BSD,[,edit,],
,PC-BSD, is a desktop version of FreeBSD, which inherits ,FreeBSD,'s ,ZFS, support, similarly to ,FreeNAS,. The new graphical installer of ,PC-BSD, can handle ,/ (,root,) on ZFS, and ,RAID-Z, pool installs and ,disk encryption, using ,Geli, right from the start in an easy convenient (,GUI,) way. The current PC-BSD 9.0+ 'Isotope Edition' has ZFS filesystem version 5 and ZFS storage pool version 28.

,Plan 9,[,edit,],
,Plan 9 from Bell Labs, treats everything as a file and accesses all objects as a file would be accessed (i.e., there is no ,ioctl, or ,mmap,): networking, graphics, debugging, authentication, capabilities, encryption, and other services are accessed via I/O operations on ,file descriptors,.  The ,9P, protocol removes the difference between local and remote files.  File systems in Plan 9 are organized with the help of private, per-process namespaces, allowing each process to have a different view of the many file systems that provide resources in a distributed system.
,The ,Inferno, operating system shares these concepts with Plan 9.
,
,Microsoft Windows,[,edit,],
,  ,Directory listing in a ,Windows, command shell,
,Windows makes use of the ,FAT,, ,NTFS,, ,exFAT,, ,Live File System, and ,ReFS, file systems (the last of these is only supported and usable in ,Windows Server 2012,, ,Windows Server 2016,, ,Windows 8,, ,Windows 8.1,, and ,Windows 10,; Windows cannot boot from it).
,Windows uses a ,drive letter, abstraction at the user level to distinguish one disk or partition from another. For example, the ,path, ,C:\WINDOWS, represents a directory ,WINDOWS, on the partition represented by the letter C. Drive C: is most commonly used for the primary ,hard disk drive, partition, on which Windows is usually installed and from which it boots. This ""tradition"" has become so firmly ingrained that bugs exist in many applications which make assumptions that the drive that the operating system is installed on is C. The use of drive letters, and the tradition of using ""C"" as the drive letter for the primary hard disk drive partition, can be traced to ,MS-DOS,, where the letters A and B were reserved for up to two floppy disk drives. This in turn derived from ,CP/M, in the 1970s, and ultimately from IBM's ,CP/CMS, of 1967.
,
,FAT,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,File Allocation Table,
,The family of ,FAT, file systems is supported by almost all operating systems for personal computers, including all versions of ,Windows, and ,MS-DOS,/,PC DOS,, ,OS/2,, and ,DR-DOS,. (PC DOS is an OEM version of MS-DOS, MS-DOS was originally based on ,SCP,'s ,86-DOS,. DR-DOS was based on ,Digital Research,'s ,Concurrent DOS,, a successor of ,CP/M-86,.) The FAT file systems are therefore well-suited as a universal exchange format between computers and devices of most any type and age.
,The FAT file system traces its roots back to an (incompatible) 8-bit FAT precursor in ,Standalone Disk BASIC, and the short-lived ,MDOS/MIDAS, project.,[,citation needed,],
,Over the years, the file system has been expanded from ,FAT12, to ,FAT16, and ,FAT32,. Various features have been added to the file system including ,subdirectories,, ,codepage, support, ,extended attributes,, and ,long filenames,. Third parties such as Digital Research have incorporated optional support for deletion tracking, and volume/directory/file-based multi-user security schemes to support file and directory passwords and permissions such as read/write/execute/delete access rights. Most of these extensions are not supported by Windows.
,The FAT12 and FAT16 file systems had a limit on the number of entries in the ,root directory, of the file system and had restrictions on the maximum size of FAT-formatted disks or ,partitions,.
,FAT32 addresses the limitations in FAT12 and FAT16, except for the file size limit of close to 4 GB, but it remains limited compared to NTFS.
,FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 also have a limit of eight characters for the file name, and three characters for the extension (such as ,.exe,). This is commonly referred to as the ,8.3 filename, limit. ,VFAT,, an optional extension to FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32, introduced in ,Windows 95, and ,Windows NT 3.5,, allowed long file names (,LFN,) to be stored in the FAT file system in a backwards compatible fashion.
,
,NTFS,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,NTFS,
,NTFS,, introduced with the ,Windows NT, operating system in 1993, allowed ,ACL,-based permission control. Other features also supported by ,NTFS, include hard links, multiple file streams, attribute indexing, quota tracking, sparse files, encryption, compression, and reparse points (directories working as mount-points for other file systems, symlinks, junctions, remote storage links).
,
,exFAT,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,exFAT,
,exFAT, is a proprietary and patent-protected file system with certain advantages over NTFS with regard to ,file system overhead,.
,exFAT is not backward compatible with FAT file systems such as FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. The file system is supported with newer Windows systems, such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
,exFAT is supported in macOS starting with version 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard).,[25],  Support in other operating systems is sparse since implementing support for exFAT requires a license. exFAT is the only file system that is fully supported on both macOS and Windows that can hold files larger than 4 GB.,[,citation needed,],
,
,OpenVMS,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Files-11,
,MVS,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,MVS § MVS filesystem,
,Prior to the introduction of ,VSAM,, ,OS/360, systems implemented an unusual hybrid file system. The system was designed to easily support ,removable disk packs,, so the information relating to all files on one disk (,volume, in IBM terminology) is stored on that disk in a ,flat system file, called the ,Volume Table of Contents, (VTOC). The VTOC stores all metadata for the file. Later a hierarchical directory structure was imposed with the introduction of the ,System Catalog,, which can optionally catalog files (datasets) on resident and removable volumes.  The catalog only contains information to relate a dataset to a specific volume. If the user requests access to a dataset on an offline volume, and they have suitable privileges, the system will attempt to mount the required volume. Cataloged and non-cataloged datasets can still be accessed using information in the VTOC, bypassing the catalog,  if the required volume id is provided to the OPEN request. Still later the VTOC was indexed to speed up access.
,
,Conversational Monitor System,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,CMS file system,
,The IBM ,Conversational Monitor System, (CMS) component of ,VM/370, uses a separate flat file system for each ,virtual disk, (,minidisk,). File data and control information are scattered and intermixed. The anchor is a record called the ,Master File Directory, (MFD), always located in the fourth block on the disk. Originally CMS used fixed-length 800-byte blocks, but later versions used larger size blocks up to 4K. Access to a data record requires two levels of ,indirection,, where the file's directory entry (called a ,File Status Table, (FST) entry) points to blocks containing a list of addresses of the individual records.
,
,AS/400 file system,[,edit,],
,Data on the AS/400 and its successors consists of system objects mapped into the system virtual address space in a ,single-level store,. Many types of ,AS/400 objects, are defined including the directories and files found in other file systems. File objects, along with other types of objects, form the basis of the AS/400's support for an integrated ,relational database,.
,
,Other file systems,[,edit,],
,The Prospero File System is a file system based on the Virtual System Model.,[26], The system was created by Dr. B. Clifford Neuman of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.,
,RSRE FLEX file system, - written in ,ALGOL 68,
,The file system of the ,Michigan Terminal System, (MTS) is interesting because: (i) it provides ""line files"" where record lengths and line numbers are associated as metadata with each record in the file, lines can be added, replaced, updated with the same or different length records, and deleted anywhere in the file without the need to read and rewrite the entire file; (ii) using program keys files may be shared or permitted to commands and programs in addition to users and groups; and (iii) there is a comprehensive file locking mechanism that protects both the file's data and its metadata.,[27],[28],
,Limitations,[,edit,],
,Converting the type of a file system,[,edit,],
,It may be advantageous or necessary to have files in a different file system than they currently exist. Reasons include the need for an increase in the space requirements beyond the limits of the current file system. The depth of path may need to be increased beyond the restrictions of the file system. There may be performance or reliability considerations. Providing access to another operating system which does not support the existing file system is another reason.
,
,In-place conversion,[,edit,],
,In some cases conversion can be done in-place, although migrating the file system is more conservative, as it involves a creating a copy of the data and is recommended.,[29], On Windows, FAT and FAT32 file systems can be converted to NTFS via the convert.exe utility, but not the reverse.,[29], On Linux, ext2 can be converted to ext3 (and converted back), and ext3 can be converted to ext4 (but not back),,[30], and both ext3 and ext4 can be converted to ,btrfs,, and converted back until the undo information is deleted.,[31], These conversions are possible due to using the same format for the file data itself, and relocating the metadata into empty space, in some cases using ,sparse file, support.,[31],
,
,Migrating to a different file system,[,edit,],
,Migration has the disadvantage of requiring additional space although it may be faster. The best case is if there is unused space on media which will contain the final file system.
,For example, to migrate a FAT32 file system to an ext2 file system. First create a new ext2 file system, then copy the data to the file system, then delete the FAT32 file system.
,An alternative, when there is not sufficient space to retain the original file system until the new one is created, is to use a work area (such as a removable media). This takes longer but a backup of the data is a nice side effect.
,
,Long file paths and long file names,[,edit,],
,In hierarchical file systems, files are accessed by means of a ,path, that is a branching list of directories containing the file. Different file systems have different limits on the depth of the path. File systems also have a limit on the length of an individual filename.
,Copying files with long names or located in paths of significant depth from one file system to another may cause undesirable results. This depends on how the utility doing the copying handles the discrepancy.

" 25 May 2020, at 01:51","Software version that is stable and supported under a long-term or extended contract,
,Long-term support, (,LTS,) is a ,product lifecycle management, ,policy, in which a ,stable release, of ,computer software, is ,maintained, for a longer period of time than the standard edition. The term is typically reserved for ,open-source software,, where it describes a software edition that is supported for months or years longer than the software's standard edition.
,Short term support, (STS) is a term that distinguishes the support policy for the software's standard edition. STS software has a comparatively short life cycle, and may be afforded new features that are omitted from the LTS edition to avoid potentially compromising the stability or compatibility of the LTS release.,[1],

,Characteristics,[,edit,],
,LTS applies the tenets of ,reliability engineering, to the ,software development process, and ,software release life cycle,. Long-term support extends the period of ,software maintenance,; it also alters the type and frequency of software updates (,patches,) to reduce the ,risk,, expense, and disruption of ,software deployment,, while promoting the ,dependability, of the software. It does not necessarily imply ,technical support,.
,At the beginning of a long-term support period, the ,software developers, impose a ,feature freeze,: They make patches to correct ,software bugs, and ,vulnerabilities,, but do not introduce new ,features, that may cause ,regression,. The ,software maintainer, either distributes patches individually, or packages them in ,maintenance releases,, ,point releases,, or ,service packs,. At the conclusion of the support period, the product either reaches ,end-of-life,, or receives a reduced level of support for a period of time (e.g., high-priority security patches only).,[2],
,
,Rationale,[,edit,],
,See also: ,IT risk management, and ,Software quality,
,Before upgrading software, a ,decision-maker, might consider the ,risk, and cost of the upgrade.,[3],
,As software developers add new features and fix software bugs, they can accidentally introduce new bugs or break old functionality.,[4], When such a flaw occurs in software, it is called a ,regression,.,[4], Two ways that a ,software publisher, or ,maintainer, can reduce the ,risk, of regression are to release major updates less frequently, and to allow users to test an alternate, updated version of the software.,[3],[5], LTS software applies these two risk-reduction strategies. The LTS edition of the software is published in parallel with the STS (short-term support) edition. Since major updates to the STS edition are published more frequently, it offers LTS users a preview of changes that might be incorporated into the LTS edition when those changes are judged to be of sufficient ,quality,.
,While using older versions of software may avoid the risks associated with upgrading, it may introduce the risk of losing support for the old software.,[6], Long-term support addresses this by assuring ,users, and ,administrators, that the software will be maintained for a specific period of time, and that updates selected for publication will carry a significantly reduced risk of regression.,[2], The maintainers of LTS software only publish updates that either have low ,IT risk, or that reduce IT risk (such as ,security patches,). ,Patches, for LTS software are published with the understanding that installing them is less risky than not installing them.
,
,Software with separate LTS versions,[,edit,],
,This table only lists those have a specific LTS version in addition to a normal release cycle. Many projects, such as ,CentOS,, provide a long period of support for every release.

,The Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) (previously Long-Term Servicing Branch) releases of Windows 10 are supported for 10 years for mission critical machines. The LTSC release gets monthly security updates; the updates to the LTSC release bring little to no feature changes. Every 2-3 years, a new major LTSC release is published, but businesses may opt to stay on their current LTSC version until its end-of-life. The LTSC release is available only for businesses running the Windows 10 Enterprise edition. Regular consumers on the Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) get new versions of the operating system approximately every six months (previously every four months) while business customers get upgraded to new versions of SAC approximately four months after Microsoft released the SAC release for regular consumers (previously a separate release is done approximately every eight months).,[36],
,
,1.,^,  The support period for Ubuntu's parent distribution, ,Debian,, is one year after the release of the next stable version.,[37],[38], Since Debian 6.0 ""Squeeze"", LTS support (bug fixes and security patches) was added to all version releases,[39],. The total LTS support time is generally around 5 years for every version.,[40],[41],. Due to the irregular release cycle of Debian, support times might vary from that average,[41], and the LTS support is done not by the Debian team but by a separate group of volunteers,[42],.,

,  ,The modern Dvorak layout (US layout),
,Dvorak, ,/,ˈ,d,v,ɔːr,æ,k,/, ,(,listen,),[1], is a ,keyboard layout, for ,English, patented in 1936 by ,August Dvorak, and his brother-in-law, William Dealey as a faster and more ,ergonomic, alternative to the ,QWERTY, layout (the ,de facto, standard keyboard layout). Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces ,repetitive strain injuries,,,[2], or is simply more comfortable than ,QWERTY,.,[3],[4],
,Although Dvorak has failed to replace QWERTY, most major modern ,operating systems, (such as ,Windows,,,[5], ,macOS,, ,Linux,, ,Android,, ,Chrome OS,, and ,BSD,) allow a user to switch to the Dvorak layout. ,iOS, does not provide a system-wide, touchscreen Dvorak keyboard, although ,third-party software, is capable of adding the layout to iOS, and the layout can be chosen for use with any hardware keyboard, regardless of printed layout.
,Several modifications were designed by the team directed by Dvorak or by ,ANSI,. These variations have been collectively or individually termed the ,Dvorak Simplified Keyboard,, the ,American Simplified Keyboard, or simply the ,Simplified Keyboard,, but they all have come to be known commonly as the ,Dvorak keyboard, or ,Dvorak layout,.

,Overview,[,edit,],
,Dvorak was designed with the belief that it would significantly increase ,typing, speeds with respect to the QWERTY layout by alleviating some of its perceived shortcomings, such as:,[6],
,
,Many common letter combinations require awkward finger motions.,
,Some common letter combinations are typed with the same finger. (e.g. ""ed"" and ""de""),
,Many common letter combinations require a finger to jump over the home row.,
,Many common letter combinations are typed with one hand while the other sits idle (e.g. was, were).,
,Most typing is done with the left hand, which for most people is not the dominant hand.,
,About 16% of typing is done on the lower row, 52% on the top row and only 32% on the home row.,
,August Dvorak studied ,letter frequencies, and the ,physiology, of the hand and created a new layout to alleviate the above problems, based on the following principles:,[6],
,
,Letters should be typed by alternating between hands (which makes typing more rhythmic, increases speed, reduces error, and reduces fatigue). On a Dvorak keyboard, vowels and the most used symbol characters are on the left (with the vowels on the home row), while the most used consonants are on the right.,
,For maximum speed and efficiency, the ,most common letters, and ,bigrams, should be typed on the ,home row,, where the fingers rest, and under the strongest fingers (Thus, about 70% of letter keyboard strokes on Dvorak are done on the home row and only 22% and 8% on the top and bottom rows respectively).,
,The least common letters should be on the bottom row which is the hardest row to reach.,
,The right hand should do more of the typing because most people are right-handed.,
,Digraphs, should not be typed with adjacent fingers.,
,Stroking should generally move from the edges of the board to the middle. An observation of this principle is that, for many people, when tapping fingers on a table, it is easier going from little finger to index than vice versa. This motion on a keyboard is called ,inboard stroke flow,.,[7],
,The Dvorak layout is intended for the English language. For other European languages, letter frequencies, letter sequences, and bigrams differ from those of English. Also, many languages have letters that do not occur in English. For non-English use, these differences lessen the alleged advantages of the original Dvorak keyboard. However, the Dvorak principles have been applied to the design of keyboards for other languages, though the primary keyboards used by most countries are based on the QWERTY design.
,The layout was completed in 1932 and granted ,U.S. Patent 2,040,248, in 1936.,[8], The ,American National Standards Institute, (ANSI) designated the Dvorak keyboard as an alternative standard keyboard layout in 1982 (INCITS 207-1991 R2007; previously X4.22-1983, X3.207:1991),,[9], ""Alternate Keyboard Arrangement for Alphanumeric Machines"". The original ANSI Dvorak layout was available as a factory-supplied option on the original ,IBM Selectric typewriter,.,[,specify,],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,August Dvorak was an educational psychologist and professor of education at the ,University of Washington, ,Seattle,.,[10], ,Touch typing, had come into wide use by that time, and Dvorak became interested in the layout while serving as an advisor to Gertrude Ford, who was writing her master's thesis on typing errors. He quickly concluded that the QWERTY layout needed to be replaced. Dvorak was joined by his brother-in-law William Dealey, a professor of education at the then ,North Texas State Teacher's College, in ,Denton, Texas,.
,Dvorak and Dealey's objective was to scientifically design a keyboard to decrease typing errors, speed up typing, and lessen typist fatigue. They engaged in extensive research while designing their keyboard layout. In 1914 and 1915, Dealey attended seminars on the science of motion and later reviewed slow-motion films of typists with Dvorak. Dvorak and Dealey meticulously studied the English language, researching the most used letters and letter combinations. They also studied the physiology of the hand. The result in 1932 was the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard.,[11],
,In 1893, George Blickensderfer had developed a keyboard layout for the ,Blickensderfer typewriter, model 5 that used the letters ,DHIATENSOR, for the home row. Blickensderfer had determined that 85% of English words contained these letters. The Dvorak keyboard uses the same letters in its home row, apart from replacing R with U, and even keeps the consonants in the same order, but moves the vowels to the left: ,AOEUIDHTNS,.
,In 1933, Dvorak started entering typists trained on his keyboard into the International Commercial Schools Contest, which were typing contests sponsored by typewriter manufacturers consisting of professional and amateur contests. The professional contests had typists sponsored by typewriter companies to advertise their machines. QWERTY typists became disconcerted by the rapid-fire clacking of the Dvorak typists, and asked for separate seating.,[,better source needed,],[12],
,In the 1930s, the ,Tacoma, Washington, school district, ran an experimental program in typing designed by Dvorak to determine whether to hold Dvorak layout classes. The experiment put 2,700 highschool students through Dvorak typing classes and found that students learned Dvorak in one-third the time it took to learn QWERTY. When a new school board was elected, however, it chose to terminate the Dvorak classes.,[12], During World War II, while in the Navy, Dvorak conducted experiments which he claimed showed that typists could be retrained to Dvorak in a mere 10 days, though he discarded at least two previous studies which were conducted and whose results are unknown.,[13],
,With such great apparent gains, interest in the Dvorak keyboard layout increased by the early 1950s. Numerous businesses and government organizations began to consider retraining their typists on Dvorak keyboards. In this environment, the ,General Services Administration, commissioned ,Earle Strong, to determine whether the switch from QWERTY to Dvorak should be made. After retraining a selection of typists from QWERTY to Dvorak, once the Dvorak group had regained their previous typing speed (which took 100 hours of training, more than was claimed in Dvorak's Navy test), Strong took a second group of QWERTY typists chosen for equal ability to the Dvorak group and retrained them in QWERTY in order to improve their speed at the same time the Dvorak typists were training.
,The carefully controlled study failed to show any benefit to the Dvorak keyboard layout in typing or training speed. Strong recommended speed training with QWERTY rather than switching keyboards, and attributed the previous apparent benefits of Dvorak to improper experimental design and outright bias on the part of Dvorak, who had designed and directed the previous studies. However, Strong had a personal grudge against Dvorak and had made public statements before his study opposing new keyboard designs.,[14], After this study, interest in the Dvorak keyboard waned.,[13], Later experiments have shown that many keyboard designs, including some alphabetical ones, allow very similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak when typists have been trained for them, suggesting that Dvorak's careful design principles may have had little effect because keyboard layout is only a small part of the complicated physical activity of typing.,[15],
,The work of Dvorak paved the way for other optimized ,keyboard layouts, for English such as ,Colemak,, but also for other languages such as the German ,Neo, and the French ,BÉPO,.,[16],
,
,Original Dvorak layout,[,edit,],
,  ,The typewriter keyboard layout that Dvorak & Dealey patented.,
,  ,The Dvorak typewriter keyboard layout that was publicly promulgated.,
,Over the decades, symbol keys were shifted around the keyboard resulting in variations of the Dvorak design. In 1982, the ,American National Standards Institute, (ANSI) implemented a standard for the Dvorak layout known as ANSI X4.22-1983. This standard gave the Dvorak layout official recognition as an alternative to the QWERTY keyboard.,[17],
,The layout standardized by the ANSI differs from the original or ""classic"" layout devised and promulgated by Dvorak. Indeed, the layout promulgated publicly by Dvorak differed slightly from the layout for which Dvorak & Dealey applied for a patent in 1932—- most notably in the placement of Z. Today's keyboards have more keys than the original typewriter did, and other significant differences existed:
,
,The numeric keys of the classic Dvorak layout are ordered: 7 5 3 1 9 0 2 4 6 8 (used today by the Programmer Dvorak,[18], layout),
,In the classic Dvorak layout, the question mark key [?] is in the leftmost position of the upper row, while the slash key [/] is in the rightmost position of the upper row.,
,For the classic Dvorak layout, the following symbols share keys (the second symbol being printed when the SHIFT key is pressed):
,colon [:] and question mark [?],
,ampersand [&] and slash [/].,
,Modern U.S. Dvorak layouts almost always place semicolon and colon together on a single key, and slash and question mark together on a single key. Thus, if the keycaps of a modern keyboard are rearranged so that the unshifted symbol characters match the classic Dvorak layout then the result is the ANSI Dvorak layout.
,
,Availability in operating systems,[,edit,],
,Dvorak is included with all major ,operating systems, (such as ,Windows,, ,macOS,, ,Linux, and ,BSD,). Since the introduction of iOS 8 in 2014, Apple iPhone and iPad users have been able to install third party keyboards on their touchscreen devices which allow for alternative keyboard layouts such as Dvorak on a system wide basis.
,
,Early PCs,[,edit,],
,Although some ,word processors, could simulate alternative keyboard layouts by software, this was application specific; if more than one program was commonly used (e.g., a word processor and a ,spreadsheet,), the user could be forced to switch layouts depending on the application. Occasionally, stickers were provided to place over the keys for these layouts.
,However, ,IBM-compatible PCs, used an active, ""smart"" keyboard. Striking a key generated a key ""code"", which was sent to the computer. Thus, changing to an alternative keyboard layout was accomplished most easily by simply buying a keyboard with the new layout. Because the key codes were generated by the keyboard itself, all software would respond accordingly. In the mid to late 1980s, a small industry for replacement PC keyboards developed; although most of these were concerned with keyboard ""feel"" and/or ,programmable macros,, there were several with alternative layouts, such as Dvorak.
,
,Amiga,[,edit,],
,Amiga, operating systems from the 1986 version 1.2 onward allow the user to modify the keyboard layout by using the setmap command line utility with ""usa2"" as an argument, or later in 3.x systems by opening the keyboard input preference widget and selecting ""Dvorak"". Amiga systems versions 1.2 and 1.3 came with the Dvorak keymap on the Workbench disk. Versions 2.x came with the keymaps available on the ""Extras"" disk. In 3.0 and 3.1 systems, the keymaps were on the ""Storage"" disk. By copying the respective keymap to the Workbench disk or installing the system to a hard drive, Dvorak was usable for Workbench application programs.
,
,Microsoft Windows,[,edit,],
,Versions of Microsoft Windows including ,Windows 95,, ,Windows NT 3.51, and later have shipped with U.S. Dvorak layout capability.,[5], Free updates to use the layout on earlier Windows versions are available for download from Microsoft.
,Earlier versions, such as ,DOS 6.2,/,Windows 3.1,, included four keyboard layouts: QWERTY, two-handed Dvorak, right-hand Dvorak, and left-hand Dvorak.
,In May 2004, Microsoft published an improved version of its Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC version 1.3,[19], – current version is 1.4,[20],) that allows anyone to easily create any keyboard layout desired, thus allowing the creation and installation of any international Dvorak keyboard layout such as Dvorak Type II (for German), ,Svorak, (for Swedish) etc.
,Another advantage of the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator with respect to third-party programs for installing an international Dvorak layout is that it allows creation of a keyboard layout that automatically switches to standard (QWERTY) after pressing the two hotkeys (SHIFT and CTRL).
,
,Unix-based systems,[,edit,],
,Many operating systems based on ,UNIX,, including ,OpenBSD,, ,FreeBSD,, ,NetBSD,, ,OpenSolaris,, ,Plan 9,, and most ,Linux distributions,, can be configured to use the U.S. Dvorak layout and a handful of variants. Furthermore, all current ,Unix-like, systems with ,X.Org, and appropriate keymaps installed (and virtually all systems meant for desktop use include them) are able to use any QWERTY-labeled keyboard as a Dvorak one without any problems or additional configuration. This eliminates the burden of producing additional keymaps for every variant of QWERTY provided. Runtime layout switching is also possible.
,
,Chrome OS,[,edit,],
,Chrome OS and Chromium OS offer Dvorak, and there are three different ways to switch the keyboard to the Dvorak layout.,[21], Chrome OS includes the US Dvorak and UK Dvorak layouts.

,Apple, had Dvorak advocates since the company's early (pre-,IPO,) days. Several engineers devised hardware and software to remap the keyboard, which were used inside the company and even sold commercially.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Apple II,[,edit,],
,The Apple IIe had a keyboard ROM that translated keystrokes into characters. The ROM contained both QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, but the QWERTY layout was enabled by default. A modification could be made by pulling out the ROM, bending up four pins, soldering a resistor between two pins, soldering two others to a pair of wires connected to a ,DIP switch,, which was installed in a pre-existing hole in the back of the machine, then plugging the modified ROM back in its socket. The ""hack"" was reversible and did no damage. By flipping the switch, the user could switch from one layout to the other. This modification was entirely unofficial but was inadvertently demonstrated at the 1984 ,Comdex, show, in ,Las Vegas,, by an Apple employee whose mission was to demonstrate Apple ,Logo, II. The employee had become accustomed to the Dvorak layout and brought the necessary parts to the show, installed them in a demo machine, then did his Logo demo. Viewers, curious that he always reached behind the machine before and after allowing other people to type, asked him about the modification. He spent as much time explaining the Dvorak keyboard as explaining Logo.,[,citation needed,],
,Apple brought new interest to the Dvorak layout with the ,Apple IIc,, which had a mechanical switch above the keyboard whereby the user could switch back and forth between the QWERTY and Dvorak: this was the most official version of the IIe Dvorak mod. The IIc Dvorak layout was even mentioned by 1984 advertisements, which stated that the world's fastest typist, Barbara Blackburn, had set a record on an Apple IIc with the Dvorak layout.
,Dvorak was also selectable using the built-in control panel applet on the ,Apple II,GS,.
,
,Apple III,[,edit,],
,The ,Apple III, used a keyboard-layout file loaded from a floppy disk: the standard system-software package included QWERTY and Dvorak layout files. Changing layouts required restarting the machine.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Apple Lisa,[,edit,],
,The ,Apple Lisa, did not offer the Dvorak ,keyboard mapping,, though it was purportedly available through undocumented interfaces.,[22],
,
,Mac OS,[,edit,],
,  ,iBook, with alpha and punctuation keys manually rearranged to the Dvorak layout.,
,In the early days, Macintosh users could only use the Dvorak layout by editing the ""System"" file using Apple's ""RESource EDITor"" ,ResEdit, — which allowed users to create and edit keyboard layouts, icons, and other interface components. 
,By 1994, a package named 'Electric Dvorak' by John Rethorst provided an easily user-installable ""implementation [which] was particularly good on pre-system 7 Macs"" as freeware, and especially useful for Mac+ and Mac SE machines running MacOS 6 and 7. 
,Another third-party developer offered a utility program called MacKeymeleon, which put a menu on the menu bar that allowed on-the-fly switching of keyboard layouts. Eventually, Apple Macintosh engineers built the functionality of this utility into the standard system software, along with a few layouts: QWERTY, Dvorak, French (,AZERTY,), and other foreign-language layouts.
,
,  ,2010 Apple Wireless Keyboard in Dvorak Layout,
,Since about 1998, beginning with ,Mac OS 8.6,, Apple has included the Dvorak layout. It can be activated with the Keyboard Control Panel and selecting ""Dvorak"". The setting is applied once the Control Panel is closed out. Apple also includes a Dvorak variant they call ""Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘"". With this layout, the keyboard temporarily becomes QWERTY when the Command (⌘/Apple) key is held down. By keeping familiar keyboard shortcuts like ""close"" or ""copy"" on the same keys as ordinary QWERTY, this lets some people use their well-practiced ,muscle memory, and may make the transition easier. Mac OS and subsequently Mac OS X allow additional ""on-the-fly"" switching between layouts: a menu-bar icon (by default, a national flag that matches the current language, a 'DV' represents Dvorak and a 'DQ' represents Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘) brings up a drop-down menu, allowing the user to choose the desired layout. Subsequent keystrokes will reflect the choice, which can be reversed the same way.
,Mac OS X 10.5 ""Leopard"" and later offer a keyboard identifier program which asks users to press a few keys on their keyboards. Dvorak, QWERTY and many national variations of those designs are available. If multiple keyboards are connected to the same Mac computer, they can be configured to different layouts and use simultaneously. However should the computer shut down (lack of battery, etc.) the computer will revert to QWERTY for reboot, regardless of what layout the Admin was using.
,
,Mobile phones and PDAs,[,edit,],
,A number of mobile phones today are built with either full QWERTY keyboards or software implementations of them on a touch screen. Sometimes the keyboard layout can be changed by means of a freeware third-party utility, such as Hacker's Keyboard for ,Android,, AE Keyboard Mapper for ,Windows Mobile,, or KeybLayout for ,Symbian OS,.
,The ,RIM, ,BlackBerry, lines offer only QWERTY and its localized variants ,AZERTY, and ,QWERTZ,. Apple's ,iOS, 8.0 and later has the option to install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. iOS 4.0 and later supports external Dvorak keyboards. Google's ,Android OS, touchscreen keyboard can use Dvorak and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.,[23],
,
,Comparison of the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts,[,edit,],
,Keyboard strokes,[,edit,],
,Touch typing, requires typists to rest their fingers in the home row (QWERTY row starting with ""ASDF""). The more strokes there are in the home row, the less movement the fingers must do, thus allowing a typist to type faster, more accurately, and with less strain to the hand and fingers.
,The majority of the Dvorak layout's key strokes (70%) are done in the home row, claimed to be the easiest row to type because the fingers rest there. Additionally, the Dvorak layout requires the fewest strokes on the bottom row (the most difficult row to type). By contrast, QWERTY requires typists to move their fingers to the top row for a majority of strokes and has only 32% of the strokes done in the home row.,[24],
,Because the Dvorak layout concentrates the vast majority of key strokes to the home row, the Dvorak layout uses about 63% of the finger motion required by QWERTY, which is claimed to make the keyboard more ergonomic.,[25], In fact, it has been estimated that during a typical 8-hour day a typist's fingers will travel 25 kilometers (16 mi) on a QWERTY keyboard and only 1.6 kilometers (1 mi) on a Dvorak keyboard.,[,citation needed,], Because the Dvorak layout requires less finger motion from the typist compared to QWERTY, some users with ,repetitive strain injuries, have reported that switching from QWERTY to Dvorak alleviated or even eliminated their repetitive strain injuries;,[26],[27], however, no scientific study has been conducted verifying this.,[28],
,The typing loads between hands differs for each of the keyboard layouts. On QWERTY keyboards, 56% of the typing strokes are done by the left hand. As the right hand is dominant for the majority of people, the Dvorak keyboard puts the more often used keys on the right hand side, thereby having 56% of the typing strokes done by the right hand.,[24],
,
,Awkward strokes,[,edit,],
,Awkward strokes are undesirable because they slow down typing, increase typing errors, and increase finger strain. Hurdling is an awkward stroke requiring a single finger to jump directly from one row, over the home row to another row (e.g., typing ""minimum"" [which often comes out as ""minimun"" or ""mimimum""] on the QWERTY keyboard).,[29], In the English language, there are about 1,200 words that require a hurdle on the QWERTY layout. In contrast, there are only a few words requiring a hurdle on the Dvorak layout.,[29],[30],
,
,Hand alternation and finger repetition,[,edit,],
,Alternating hands while typing is a desirable trait because while one hand is typing a letter, the other hand can get in position to type the next letter. Thus, a typist may fall into a steady rhythm and type quickly. On the other hand, when a string of letters is done with the same hand, the chances of stuttering are increased and a rhythm can be broken, thus decreasing speed and increasing errors and fatigue. Likewise, using the same finger to type consecutive letters is also to be avoided. The QWERTY layout has more than 3,000 words that are typed on the left hand alone and about 300 words that are typed on the right hand alone (the aforementioned word ""minimum"" is a right-hand-only word). In contrast, with the Dvorak layout, only a few words are typed using only the left hand and even fewer use the right hand alone.,[24], This is because most syllables require at least one ,vowel,, and, in a Dvorak layout, all the vowels (and ""y"") fall on the left side of the keyboard.
,
,Standard keyboard,[,edit,],
,QWERTY enjoys advantages with respect to Dvorak due to the fact that it is the de facto standard keyboard:
,
,Keyboard shortcuts in most major operating systems, including Windows, are designed for QWERTY users, and can be awkward for some Dvorak users, such as Ctrl-C (Copy) and Ctrl-V (Paste). However, Apple computers have a ""Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘"" setting, which temporarily changes the keyboard mapping to QWERTY when the command (⌘) key is held, and Windows users can replicate this setting using ,AutoHotkey, scripts.,
,Some public computers (such as in libraries) will not allow users to change the keyboard to the Dvorak layout.,
,Some standardized exams will not allow test takers to use the Dvorak layout (e.g. ,Graduate Record Examination,).,
,Support for Dvorak in games, especially those that make use of "",WASD,"" - an ,ergonomic, inverted-T shape using QWERTY but spread out across the keyboard in Dvorak - for in-game movement vary. Some games will automatically detect the keyboard is in Dvorak and adjust keys to the Dvorak equivalent "",AOE"" while others allow the same effect with some manual tweaking; games with hard-coded keybinds and do not allow changing the keys away from WASD becomes practically impossible to play under Dvorak.,
,People who can ,touch type, with a QWERTY keyboard will be less productive with alternative layouts until they retrain themselves, even if these are closer to the optimum.,[31],
,Not all people use keyboard fingerings as specified in touch-typing manuals due to either preference or anatomical difference. This can change the relative efficiency on alternative layouts.,
,Variants,[,edit,],
,One-handed versions,[,edit,],
,  ,Left-handed Dvorak layout,
,  ,Right-handed Dvorak layout,
,In the 1960s, Dvorak designed left- and right-handed Dvorak layouts for touch-typing with ,only one hand,. He tried to minimize the need to move the hand from side to side (lateral travel), as well as to minimize finger movement. Each layout has the hand resting near the center of the keyboard, rather than on one side.
,Because the layouts require less hand movement than layouts designed for two hands, they can be more ,accessible, to single-handed users. The layouts are also used by people with full use of two hands, who prefer having one hand free while they type with the other.
,The left-handed Dvorak and right-handed Dvorak keyboard layouts are mostly each other's mirror image, with the exception of some punctuation keys, some of the less-used letters, and the 'wide keys' (Enter, Shift, etc.). Dvorak arranged the parentheses "")("" on his left-handed keyboard, but some keyboards place them in the typical ""()"" reading order. Illustrated here is Dvorak's original "")("" placement, above; it is the more widely distributed layout, not least because it is the one that ships with ,Windows,.
,
,Programmer Dvorak,[,edit,],
,  ,The Programmer Dvorak layout,
,Programmer Dvorak, was developed by Roland Kaufmann ,in the early 2000s,[,citation needed,], and is designed for people writing code in ,C,, ,Java,, ,Pascal,, ,Lisp,, ,HTML,, ,CSS, and ,XML,.,[32],
,While the letters are in the same places as the original layout, most symbols and numbers have been moved. The most noticeable difference is that the top row contains various brackets and other symbols, and you need to use the Shift key to type the numbers, like on typewriters. The numbers are arranged with the odds under the left hand and the evens under the right hand, as on Dvorak's original layout.
,It comes preinstalled on Linux and installers are also available for macOS and Windows.
,
,Research on efficiency,[,edit,],
,The Dvorak layout is designed to improve ,touch-typing,, in which the user rests their fingers on the home row. It would have less effect on other methods of typing such as ,hunt-and-peck,. Some studies show favorable results for the Dvorak layout in terms of speed, while others do not show any advantage, with many accusations of bias or lack of scientific rigour among researchers. The first studies were performed by Dvorak and his associates. These showed favorable results and generated accusations of bias.,[33], However, research published in 2013 by economist Ricard Torres suggests that the Dvorak layout has definite advantages.,[34],
,In 1956, a study with a sample of 10 people in each group conducted by Earle Strong of the U.S. ,General Services Administration, found Dvorak no more efficient than QWERTY,[35], and claimed it would be too costly to retrain the employees.,[31], The failure of the study to show any benefit to switching, along with its illustration of the considerable cost of switching, discouraged businesses and governments from making the switch.,[36], This study was similarly criticised as being biased in favor of the QWERTY control group.,[6],
,In the 1990s, economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen E. Margolis wrote articles in the ,Journal of Law and Economics,[33], and ,Reason, magazine,[13], where they rejected Dvorak proponents' claims that the dominance of the QWERTY is due to ,market failure, brought on by QWERTY's early adoption, writing, ""[T]he evidence in the standard history of Qwerty versus Dvorak is flawed and incomplete. [..] The most dramatic claims are traceable to Dvorak himself; and the best-documented experiments, as well as recent ergonomic studies, suggest little or no advantage for the Dvorak keyboard."",[33],[37],
,In certain forms of writing, typing speed is limited by other factors than keyboard layout. For example, the ,words per minute, (WPM) of authors and writers has not seen a noticeable increase, since thinking speed is a much larger factor than writing speed.,[,citation needed,], This would contrast with a verbatim transcription, which would rely much more heavily on keyboard layout for efficiency.
,
,Resistance to adoption,[,edit,],
,Although the Dvorak design is the only other keyboard design registered with ANSI and is provided with all major operating systems, attempts to convert universally to the Dvorak design have not succeeded. The failure of Dvorak to displace QWERTY has been the subject of some studies.,[33],[38],
,A discussion of the Dvorak layout is sometimes used as an exercise by ,management consultants, to illustrate the difficulties of ,change,. The Dvorak layout is often used in ,economics, ,textbooks, as a standard example of ,network effects,,,[39],[40], though this method has been criticized.,[33],
,Most keyboards are based on QWERTY layouts, despite the availability of other keyboard layouts, including the Dvorak.
,
,Other languages,[,edit,],
,Although DSK is implemented in many,[,citation needed,], languages other than ,English,, there are still potential issues. Every Dvorak implementation for other languages has the same difficulties as for ,Roman characters,. However, other (occidental) language ,orthographies, can have other typing needs for optimization (many are very different from English). Because Dvorak was optimized for the statistical distribution of letters of English text, keyboards for other languages would likely have different distributions of letter frequencies. Hence, non-QWERTY-derived keyboards for such languages would need a keyboard layout that might be quite different from the Dvorak layout for English.
,
,United Kingdom layouts,[,edit,],
,
,Whether Dvorak or QWERTY, a United Kingdom keyboard differs from the U.S. equivalent in these ways: the "" and @ are swapped; the backslash/pipe [\ |] key is in an extra position (to the right of the lower left shift key); there is a taller return/enter key, which places the hash/tilde [# ~] key to its lower left corner (see picture).,[,citation needed,],
,The most notable difference between the U.S. and UK Dvorak layouts is the [2 ""] key remains on the top row, whereas the U.S. [' ""] key moves. This means that the query [/ ?] key retains its classic Dvorak location, top right, albeit shifted,[,citation needed,],.
,Interchanging the [/ ?] and [' @] keys more closely matches the U.S. layout, and the use of ""@"" has increased in the information technology age. These variations, plus keeping the numerals in Dvorak's idealised order, appear in the ,Classic Dvorak, and Dvorak for the ,Left Hand, and ,Right Hand, varieties.
,
,Svorak,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,Svorak Keyboard, layout,
,The Svorak layout places the three extra Swedish ,vowels, (,å,, ,ä, and ,ö,) on the leftmost three keys of the upper row, which correspond to punctuation symbols on the English Dvorak layout. This retains the original English DVORAK design goal of keeping all vowels by the left hand, including Y which is a vowel in Swedish.
,The displaced punctuation symbols (period and comma) end up at the edges of the keyboard, but every other symbol is in the same place as in the standard Swedish ,QWERTY, layout, facilitating easier re-learning. The Alt-Gr key is required to access some of the punctation symbols. This major design goal also makes it possible to ""convert"" a Swedish QWERTY keyboard to SVORAK simply by moving keycaps around.
,Unlike for Norway, there's no standard Swedish Dvorak layout and the community is fragmented.,[41], In ,Svdvorak,, by Gunnar Parment, the punctuation symbols as they were in the English version; the first extra vowel (å) is placed in the far left of the top row while the other two (ä and ö) are placed at the far left of the bottom row.
,
,Others,[,edit,],
,The ,Norwegian, implementation (known as "",Norsk Dvorak,"") is similar to Parment's layout, with ""æ"" and ""ø"" replacing ""ä"" and ""ö"".
,The Danish layout DanskDvorak,[42], is similar to the Norwegian.
,An ,Icelandic, Dvorak layout exists, created by a student at Reykjavik University. It retains the same basic layout as the standard Dvorak but features special Alt-Gr functions to allow easy usage for common characters such as ""þ"", ""æ"", ""ö"" and dead-keys to allow the typing of characters such as ""å"" and ""ü"".
,A ,Finnish, ,DAS, keyboard layout,[43], follows many of Dvorak's design principles, but the layout is an original design based on the most common letters and letter combinations of the Finnish language. Matti Airas has also made another layout for Finnish.,[44], Finnish can also be typed reasonably well with the English Dvorak layout if the letters ä and ö are added. The Finnish ,ArkkuDvorak, keyboard layout,[45], adds both on a single key and keeps the American placement for each other character. As with ,DAS,, the ,SuoRak,[46], keyboard is designed by the same principles as the Dvorak keyboard, but with the most common letters of the Finnish language taken into account. Contrary to ,DAS,, it keeps the vowels on the left side of the keyboard and most consonants on the right hand side.
,The ,Turkish F, keyboard layout (,link in Turkish,) is also an original design with Dvorak's design principles, however it's not clear if it is inspired by Dvorak or not. Turkish F keyboard was standardized in 1955 and the design has been a requirement for imported typewriters since 1963.
,There are some non standard ,Brazilian, Dvorak keyboard designs currently in development. The simpler design (also called ,BRDK,) is just a Dvorak layout plus some keys from the Brazilian ABNT2 keyboard layout. Another design, however, was specifically designed for ,Brazilian Portuguese,, by means of a study that optimized typing statistics, like frequent letters, trigraphs and words.,[47],
,The most common ,German, Dvorak layout is the German ,Type II, layout. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. There is also the ,Neo, layout,[48], and the ,de ergo, layout,,[49], both original layouts that also use many of Dvorak's design principles. Because of the similarity of both languages, even the standard Dvorak layout (with minor modifications) is an ergonomic improvement with respect to the common QWERTZ layout. One such modification puts ß at the shift+comma position and the umlaut dots as a dead key accessible via shift+period (,standard German, keyboards have a separate less/greater key to the right of the left shift key).
,
,  ,Dvorak, with a French BÉPO layout,
,For ,French,, there is a Dvorak layout,[50], and the Bépo layout, which is founded on Dvorak's method of analysing key frequency.,[51], Although Bépo's placement of keys is optimised for French, the scheme also facilitates key combinations for typing characters of other European languages, Esperanto and various symbols.,[16],
,Three ,Spanish,[52], layouts exist.
,A ,Romanian, version of the Dvorak layout was released in October 2008. It is available for both Windows and Linux.,[53],

,The message queue paradigm is a sibling of the ,publisher/subscriber, pattern, and is typically one part of a larger ,message-oriented middleware, system. Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and message queue models in their ,API,, e.g. ,Java Message Service, (JMS).

,Overview,[,edit,],
,Message queues provide an  ,asynchronous, ,communications protocol,, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.  Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them.  Message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.
,Many implementations of message queues function internally: within an ,operating system, or within an ,application,. Such queues exist for the purposes of that ,system, only.,[1],[2],[3],
,Other implementations allow the passing of messages between different computer systems, potentially connecting multiple applications and multiple operating systems.,[4],  These message queueing systems typically provide enhanced ,resilience, functionality to ensure that messages do not get ""lost"" in the event of a system failure.  Examples of commercial implementations of this kind of message queueing ,software, (also known as ,message-oriented middleware,) include ,IBM MQ, (formerly MQ Series) and ,Oracle Advanced Queuing, (AQ).  There is a ,Java, standard called ,Java Message Service,, which has several ,proprietary, and ,free software, implementations.
,Implementations exist as proprietary software, provided as a ,service,, open source software, or a hardware-based solution.
,Proprietary options have the longest history, and include products from the inception of message queuing, such as IBM MQ, and those tied to specific operating systems, such as ,Microsoft Message Queuing,. 
,There are also cloud-based message queuing service options, such as ,Amazon Simple Queue Service, (SQS), ,StormMQ,, ,IronMQ,, ,Solace,, and ,IBM MQ, has a cloud-based managed queuing service. 
,There are a number of open source choices of messaging ,middleware, systems, including ,Apache ActiveMQ,, ,Apache Kafka,, ,Apache Qpid,[5],, ,Apache RocketMQ,, Beanstalkd, ,Enduro/X,, HTTPSQS,[6],, ,JBoss Messaging,, ,JORAM,, ,RabbitMQ,, ,Sun Open Message Queue,, and ,Tarantool,.
,In addition to open source systems, hardware-based ,messaging middleware, exists with vendors like ,Solace,, ,Apigee, and Tervela offering queuing through silicon or silicon/software datapaths. IBM also offers its MQ software on an appliance.
,Most ,real-time operating systems, (RTOSes), such as ,VxWorks, and ,QNX,, encourage the use of message queueing as the primary inter-process or inter-thread communication mechanism.  The resulting tight integration between message passing and CPU scheduling is attributed as a main reason for the usability of RTOSes for real time applications.  Early examples of commercial RTOSes that encouraged a message-queue basis to inter-thread communication also include ,VRTX, and ,pSOS,+, both of which date to the early 1980s. The ,Erlang programming language, uses ,processes, to provide concurrency; these processes communicate asynchronously using message queuing.
,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,In a typical message-queueing implementation, a ,system administrator, installs and configures message-queueing software (a ,queue manager, or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a ,message queuing service,.
,An application then registers a software routine that ""listens"" for messages placed onto the queue.
,Second and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it.
,The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine.  The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner.
,There are often numerous options as to the exact semantics of message passing, including:
,
,Durability - messages may be kept in memory, written to disk, or even committed to a ,DBMS, if the need for reliability indicates a more resource-intensive solution.,
,Security policies - which applications should have access to these messages?,
,Message purging policies - queues or messages may have a "",time to live,"",
,Message filtering - some systems support filtering data so that a subscriber may only see messages matching some pre-specified criteria of interest,
,Delivery policies - do we need to guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, or no more than once?,
,Routing policies - in a system with many queue servers, what servers should receive a message or a queue's messages?,
,Batching policies - should messages be delivered immediately?   Or should the system wait a bit and try to deliver many messages at once?,
,Queuing criteria - when should a message be considered ""enqueued""?  When one queue has it?  Or when it has been forwarded to at least one remote queue?  Or to all queues?,
,Receipt notification - A publisher may need to know when some or all subscribers have received a message.,
,These are all considerations that can have substantial effects on transaction semantics, system reliability, and system efficiency.
,
,Standards and protocols,[,edit,],
,Historically, message queuing has used proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments.
,An early attempt to make message queuing more ubiquitous was ,Sun Microsystems,' ,JMS, specification, which provided a ,Java,-only abstraction of a client ,API,. This allowed Java developers to switch between providers of message queuing in a fashion similar to that of developers using ,SQL, databases. In practice, given the diversity of message queuing techniques and scenarios, this wasn't always as practical as it could be.
,Three standards have emerged which are used in open source message queue implementations:
,
,Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, (AMQP) – feature-rich message queue protocol, approved as ISO/IEC 19464 since April 2014,
,Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, (STOMP) – simple, text-oriented message protocol,
,MQTT, (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) - lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devices,
,These protocols are at different stages of standardization and adoption. The first two operate at the same level as ,HTTP,, MQTT at the level of ,TCP/IP,.
,Some proprietary implementations also use HTTP to provide message queuing by some implementations, such as ,Amazon,'s ,SQS,. This is because it is always possible to layer asynchronous behaviour (which is what is required for message queuing) over a synchronous protocol using request-response semantics. However, such implementations are constrained by the underlying protocol in this case and may not be able to offer the full fidelity or set of options required in message passing above.
,
,Synchronous vs. asynchronous,[,edit,],
,Many of the more widely known ,communications protocols, in use operate ,synchronously,.  The HTTP protocol – used in the ,World Wide Web, and in ,web services, – offers an obvious example where a user sends a request for a web page and then waits for a reply.
,However, scenarios exist in which synchronous behaviour is not appropriate.  For example, ,AJAX, (,Asynchronous, ,JavaScript, and ,XML,) can be used to asynchronously send text, JSON or XML messages to update part of a web page with more relevant information.  ,Google, uses this approach for their ,Google Suggest,, a search feature which sends the user's partially typed queries to Google's servers and returns a list of possible full queries the user might be interested in the process of typing. This list is asynchronously updated as the user types.
,Other asynchronous examples exist in event notification systems and publish/subscribe systems.
,
,An application may need to notify another that an event has occurred, but does not need to wait for a response.,
,In ,publish/subscribe, systems, an application ""publishes"" information for any number of clients to read.,
,In both of the above examples it would not make sense for the sender of the information to have to wait if, for example, one of the recipients had crashed.
,Applications need not be exclusively synchronous or asynchronous. An interactive application may need to respond to certain parts of a request immediately (such as telling a customer that a sales request has been accepted, and handling the promise to draw on inventory), but may queue other parts (such as completing calculation of billing, forwarding data to the central accounting system, and calling on all sorts of other services) to be done some time later.
,In all these sorts of situations, having a subsystem which performs message-queuing (or alternatively, a broadcast messaging system) can help improve the behavior of the overall system.
,
,Implementation in UNIX,[,edit,],
,There are two common message queue implementations in UNIX. One is part of the SYS V API, the other one is part of ,POSIX,.
,
,SYS V,[,edit,],
,UNIX SYS V implements message passing by keeping an array of linked lists as message queues. Each message queue is identified by its index in the array, and has a unique descriptor. A given index can have multiple possible descriptors. UNIX gives standard functions to access the message passing feature.,[7],
,
,msgget(),
,This system call takes a key as an argument and returns a descriptor of the queue with the matching key if it exists. If it does not exist, and the ,IPC_CREAT, flag is set, it makes a new message queue with the given key and returns its descriptor.,
,msgrcv(),
,Used to receive a message from a given queue descriptor. The caller process must have read permissions for the queue. It is of two types.,[8],
,Blocking receive puts the child to sleep if it cannot find a requested message type. It sleeps till another message is posted in the queue, and then wakes up to check again.,
,Non-blocking receive returns immediately to the caller, mentioning that it failed.,
,msgctl(),
,Used to change message queue parameters like the owner. Most importantly, it is used to delete the message queue by passing the ,IPC_RMID, flag. A message queue can be deleted only by its creator, owner, or the superuser.,
,POSIX,[,edit,],
,The POSIX.1-2001 message queue API is the later of the two UNIX message queue APIs. It is distinct from the SYS V API, but provides similar function.

,In ,software development,, a ,codebase, (or ,code base,) is a collection of ,source code, used to ,build, a particular ,software system,, ,application,, or ,software component,. Typically, a codebase includes only human-written ,source code, files; thus, a codebase usually does not include source code files generated by tools (generated files) or binary library files (object files), as they can be built from the human-written source code. However, it generally does include configuration and property files, as they are the data necessary for the build.
,A codebase is typically stored in a ,source control, repository in a ,version control, system. For smaller projects it may be kept as a simple set of files (even the ,Linux kernel, was maintained as a set of files for many years).,[1], A source code repository is a place where large amounts of source code are kept, either publicly or privately. Source code repositories are used most basically for backups and versioning, and on multi-developer projects to handle various source code versions and to provide aid in resolving conflicts that arise from developers submitting overlapping modifications. ,Subversion,, ,Git, and ,Mercurial, are examples of popular tools used to handle this workflow, which are common in open source projects.

,Distinct and monolithic codebases,[,edit,],
,Multiple projects can have separate, ,distinct codebases,, or can have a single, ,shared, or ,monolithic codebase,., This is particularly the case for related projects, such as those developed within the same company. In more detail, a monolithic codebase typically entails a single repository (all the code in one place), and often a common build system or common libraries. Whether the codebase is shared or split does not depend on the system architecture and actual build results; thus, a monolithic codebase, which is related to the actual development, does not entail a ,monolithic system,, which is related to software architecture or a single monolithic binary. As a result, a monolithic codebase may and (for large codebases) often will consist of separate components, instead of carrying only a single system or single binary; a distributed codebase (with multiple components) can be used to build a single monolithic system or even a single binary. For example, the Linux kernel is architecturally a single ,monolithic kernel,, but it consists of separate binaries (loadable components), and is developed in multiple distributed repositories.
,There are both advantages and disadvantages to a monolithic codebase, when it is compared to a distributed codebase.,[2],[3], Most simply, a monolithic codebase simplifies integration‍—‌changes to different components or refactoring of code between components can be done easily and atomically‍—‌and allows operations across the entire codebase, but requires a larger repository and makes it easier to introduce wide-ranging ,technical debt,.,[,dubious, , – ,discuss,], A separate codebase or a distributed codebase keeps individual repositories smaller and more manageable, enforcing at the same time separation between components, but it also requires integration between codebases (or with the main repository), and complicates changes that span multiple codebases.,[4],
,In terms of standards, referring to multiple codebases as ""distinct"" declares that there are independent implementations without shared source code and that, historically, these implementations did not evolve from a common project. This may be a way of demonstrating interoperability by showing two independent pieces of software that implement a given standard.,[,dubious, , – ,discuss,],
,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,Some notably large codebases include:
,
,Google,: monolithic, 1 billion files, 9 million source code files, 2 billion lines of source code, 35 million commits in total, 86 TB total size (January 2015),[5],
,Facebook,: monolithic, 8 GB (repo 54 GB including history, 2014),,[6], hundreds of thousands of files (2014),[3],
,Linux kernel,: distributed,,[7], over 15 million lines of code (as of 2013,[update], and kernel version 3.10),

,Software deployment, is all of the activities that make a ,software system, available for use.,[1],
,The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the ,producer, side or at the ,consumer, side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise ,processes, or ,procedures, within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, ""deployment"" should be interpreted as a ,general process, that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.,[2],

,History,[,edit,],
,This section ,needs expansion,. ,You can help by ,adding to it,.,  ,(,January 2017,),
,When computers were extremely large, expensive and bulky (,mainframes, and ,minicomputers,), software was often bundled together with the hardware by manufacturers. If ,business software, needed to be installed on an existing computer, this might require an expensive, time-consuming visit by a ,systems architect, or a ,consultant,. For complex, on-premises installation of ,enterprise software, today, this can still sometimes be the case.
,However, with the development of ,mass market, software for the new age of ,microcomputers, in the 1980s came new forms of software distribution –  first ,cartridges,, then ,Compact Cassettes,, then ,floppy disks,, then (in the 1990s and later) ,optical media,, the ,internet, and ,flash drives,. This meant that software deployment could be left to the customer. However, it was also increasingly recognised over time that configurability of the software by the customer was important, and that this should ideally have a user-friendly interface (rather than, for example, requiring the customer to edit registry entries on Windows).
,In pre-internet software deployments, deployments (and their closely related cousin, new software releases) were of necessity expensive, infrequent, bulky affairs. It is arguable therefore that the spread of the internet made end-to-end ,agile software development, possible. Indeed, the advent of ,cloud computing, and ,software as a service, meant that software could be deployed to a large number of customers in minutes, over the internet. This also meant that typically, deployment schedules were now determined by the software supplier, not by the customers. Such flexibility led to the rise of ,continuous delivery, as a viable option, especially for less risky ,web applications,.
,
,Deployment activities,[,edit,],
,Release,
,The ,release, activity follows from the completed ,development, process, and is sometimes classified as part of the development process rather than deployment process. It includes all the operations to prepare a system for ,assembly, and transfer to the computer system(s) on which it will be run in production. Therefore, it sometimes involves determining the ,resources, required for the system to operate with tolerable performance and planning and/or documenting subsequent activities of the deployment process.,
,Installation and activation,
,For simple systems, ,installation, involves establishing some form of ,command,, shortcut, script or ,service, for executing the software (manually or automatically). For complex systems it may involve configuration of the system –  possibly by asking the enduser questions about its intended use, or directly asking them how they would like it to be configured –  and/or making all the required subsystems ready to use. Activation is the activity of starting up the ,executable, component of software for the first time (not to be confused with the common use of the term ,activation, concerning a software license, which is a function of ,Digital Rights Management, systems.),
,In larger software deployments on ,servers,, the main copy of the software to be used by users - ""production"" - might be installed on a production server in a production environment.  Other versions of the deployed software may be installed in a ,test environment,, ,development environment, and disaster recovery environment.,
,In complex ,continuous delivery, environments and/or ,software as a service, systems, differently-configured versions of the system might even exist simultaneously in the production environment for different internal or external customers (this is known as a ,multi-tenant architecture,), or even be gradually rolled out in parallel to different groups of customers, with the possibility of cancelling one or more of the parallel deployments. For example, ,Twitter, is known to use the latter approach for ,A/B testing, of new features and ,user interface, changes. A ""hidden live"" group can also be created within a production environment, consisting of servers that are not yet connected to the production ,load balancer,, for the purposes of ,blue-green deployment,.,
,Deactivation,
,Deactivation is the inverse of activation, and refers to shutting down any already-executing components of a system. Deactivation is often required to perform other deployment activities, e.g., a software system may need to be deactivated before an update can be performed.  The practice of removing infrequently used or obsolete systems from service is often referred to as ,application retirement, or application decommissioning.,
,Uninstallation,
,Uninstallation is the inverse of installation. It is the removal of a system that is no longer required. It may also involve some reconfiguration of other software systems in order to remove the uninstalled system's ,dependencies,.,
,Update,
,The update process replaces an earlier version of all or part of a software system with a newer release. It commonly consists of deactivation followed by installation. On some systems, such as on Linux when using the system's ,package manager,, the old version of a software application is typically also uninstalled as an automatic part of the process. (This is because Linux package managers do not typically support installing multiple versions of a software application at the same time, unless the software package has been specifically designed to ,work around, this limitation.),
,Built-in update,
,Mechanisms for installing updates are built into some software systems (or, in the case of some operating systems such as ,Linux,, ,Android, and ,iOS,, into the operating system itself). Automation of these update processes ranges from fully automatic to user initiated and controlled. ,Norton Internet Security, is an example of a system with a semi-automatic method for retrieving and installing updates to both the antivirus definitions and other components of the system. Other software products provide query mechanisms for determining when updates are available.,
,Version tracking,
,Version tracking systems help the user find and install updates to software systems. For example: Software Catalog stores version and other information for each software package installed on a local system. One click of a button launches a browser window to the upgrade web page for the application, including auto-filling of the user name and password for sites that require a login. On Linux, Android and iOS this process is even easier because a standardised process for version tracking (for software packages installed in the officially supported way) is built into the operating system, so no separate login, download and execute steps are required –  so the process can be configured to be fully automated. Some third-party software also supports automated version tracking and upgrading for certain Windows software packages.,
,Deployment roles,[,edit,],
,The complexity and variability of software products has fostered the emergence of specialized roles for coordinating and engineering the deployment process.  For desktop systems, end-users frequently also become the ""software deployers"" when they install a software package on their machine. The deployment of ,enterprise software, involves many more roles, and those roles typically change as the application progresses from test (pre-production) to production environments.  Typical roles involved in software deployments for enterprise applications may include:

,  ,The inside and front of a ,Dell PowerEdge, server, a computer designed to be mounted in a ,rack mount, environment.,
,A ,web server, is ,server software,, or ,hardware, dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy ,client, requests on the ,World Wide Web,. A web server can, in general, contain one or more ,websites,. A web server processes incoming ,network, requests over ,HTTP, and several other related ,protocols,.
,The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver ,web pages, to clients.,[1], The communication between client and server takes place using the ,Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),. Pages delivered are most frequently ,HTML documents,, which may include ,images,, ,style sheets, and ,scripts, in addition to the text content. 
,
,  ,Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, ,Dell, servers are installed together being used for the ,Wikimedia Foundation,.,
,A ,user agent,, commonly a ,web browser, or ,web crawler,, initiates communication by making a ,request, for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an ,error message, if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's ,secondary storage,, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is ,implemented,.
,While the major function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting ,web forms,, including ,uploading, of files.
,Many generic web servers also support ,server-side scripting, using ,Active Server Pages, (ASP), ,PHP, (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other ,scripting languages,. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents ,dynamically, (""on-the-fly"") as opposed to returning ,static documents,. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from ,databases,. The latter is typically much faster and more easily ,cached, but cannot deliver ,dynamic content,.
,Web servers can frequently be found ,embedded, in devices such as ,printers,, ,routers,, ,webcams, and serving only a ,local network,. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most ,operating systems,).

,  ,Sun's ,Cobalt Qube, 3 – a computer ,server appliance, (2002, discontinued),
,In March 1989 ,Sir Tim Berners-Lee, proposed a new project to his employer ,CERN,, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a ,hypertext, system.,[2],[3], The project resulted in Berners-Lee writing two programs in 1990:
,
,A ,Web browser, called ,WorldWideWeb,[4],
,The world's first web server, later known as ,CERN httpd,, which ran on ,NeXTSTEP,
,Between 1991 and 1994, the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the World Wide Web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among scientific organizations and universities, and subsequently to the industry.
,In 1994 Berners-Lee decided to constitute the ,World Wide Web Consortium, (W3C) to regulate the further development of the many technologies involved (,HTTP,, ,HTML,, etc.) through a standardization process.
,
,Path translation,[,edit,],
,Web servers are able to map the path component of a ,Uniform Resource Locator, (URL) into:
,
,A local ,file system, resource (for static requests),
,An internal or external program name (for dynamic requests),
,For a ,static request, the URL path specified by the client is relative to the web server's root directory.
,Consider the following URL as it would be requested by a client over HTTP:
,
,http://www.example.com/path/file.html
,
,The client's ,user agent, will translate it into a connection to ,www.example.com, with the following ,HTTP/2, request:
,
,GET /path/file.html HTTP/2
Host: www.example.com
,
,The web server on ,www.example.com, will append the given path to the path of its root directory. On an ,Apache server,, this is commonly ,/home/www, (on ,Unix, machines, usually ,/var/www,). The result is the local file system resource:
,
,/home/www/path/file.html
,
,The web server then reads the ,file,, if it exists, and sends a response to the client's web browser. The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable.
,
,Kernel-mode and user-mode web servers,[,edit,],
,A web server can be either incorporated into the ,OS, ,kernel,, or in ,user space, (like other regular applications).
,Web servers that run in ,user-mode, have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more CPU resources. Not only do these requests to the kernel take time, but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications. Executing in user mode can also mean useless buffer copies which are another limitation for user-mode web servers.
,
,Load limits,[,edit,],
,A web server (program) has defined load limits, because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections (usually between 2 and 80,000, by default between 500 and 1,000) per ,IP address, (and TCP port) and it can serve only a certain maximum number of ,requests per second, (RPS, also known as ,queries per second, or QPS) depending on:
,
,its own settings,,
,the HTTP request type,,
,whether the content is static or dynamic,,
,whether the content is ,cached,, and,
,the ,hardware, and ,software, limitations of the OS of the computer on which the web server runs.,
,When a web server is near to or over its limit, it becomes unresponsive.
,
,Causes of overload,[,edit,],
,At any time web servers can be overloaded due to:
,
,Excess legitimate web traffic. Thousands or even millions of clients connecting to the web site in a short interval, e.g., ,Slashdot effect,;,
,Distributed Denial of Service, attacks. A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users;,
,Computer worms, that sometimes cause abnormal traffic because of millions of infected computers (not coordinated among them),
,XSS worms, can cause high traffic because of millions of infected browsers or web servers;,
,Internet bots, Traffic not filtered/limited on large web sites with very few resources (bandwidth, etc.);,
,Internet, (network) slowdowns, so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached;,
,Web servers (,computers,) partial unavailability. This can happen because of required or urgent maintenance or upgrade, hardware or software failures, ,back-end, (e.g., ,database,) failures, etc.; in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and become overloaded.,
,Symptoms of overload,[,edit,],
,The symptoms of an overloaded web server are:
,
,Requests are served with (possibly long) delays (from 1 second to a few hundred seconds).,
,The web server returns an ,HTTP error code,, such as 500, 502,,[5], 503,,[6], 504,,[7], 408, or even ,404,, which is inappropriate for an overload condition.,[8],
,The web server refuses or resets (interrupts) ,TCP, connections before it returns any content.,
,In very rare cases, the web server returns only a part of the requested content. This behavior can be considered a ,bug,, even if it usually arises as a symptom of overload.,
,Anti-overload techniques,[,edit,],
,To partially overcome above average load limits and to prevent overload, most popular web sites use common techniques like:
,
,Managing network traffic, by using:
,Firewalls, to block unwanted traffic coming from bad IP sources or having bad patterns,
,HTTP traffic managers to drop, redirect or rewrite requests having bad ,HTTP, patterns,
,Bandwidth management, and ,traffic shaping,, in order to smooth down peaks in network usage,
,Deploying ,web cache, techniques,
,Using different ,domain names, or IP addresses to serve different (static and dynamic) content by separate web servers, e.g.:
,http://images.example.com,
,http://example.com,
,Using different domain names or computers to separate big files from small and medium-sized files; the idea is to be able to fully ,cache, small and medium-sized files and to efficiently serve big or huge (over 10 – 1000 MB) files by using different settings,
,Using many internet servers (programs) per computer, each one bound to its own ,network card, and ,IP address,
,Using many internet servers (computers) that are grouped together behind a ,load balancer, so that they act or are seen as one big web server,
,Adding more hardware resources (i.e. ,RAM,, ,disks,) to each computer,
,Tuning OS parameters for hardware capabilities and usage,
,Using more efficient ,computer programs, for web servers, etc.,
,Using other ,workarounds,, especially if dynamic content is involved,

,Shopping cart software, is a piece of ,e-commerce, software on a ,web server, that allows visitors to an Internet site to select items for eventual purchase.,[1],
,The software allows ,online shopping, customers to accumulate a list of items for purchase. At the ,point of sale,, the software typically calculates a ,total, for the order, including ,freight transport,, ,postage, as well as ,packaging and labeling,. Associated ,taxes, are calculated as applicable. The data is used in ,online marketing,.

,History,[,edit,],
,The development of web shop systems took place right after the ,Internet, became a mass medium. This was a result of the launch of the ,browser, ,Mosaic, in 1993 and ,Netscape, in 1994. It created an environment in which web shops were possible. The Internet therefore acted as the key infrastructure developments that contributed to the rapid diffusion of the ,e-commerce,, a subset of e-business that describes all computer-aided business transactions. In 1998 a total of 11 e-business models were observed, one of which was the e-shop business model for a ,B2C, (business-to-consumer) business—also called the “online shop” The two terms “online shop” and “electronic” or “e-shop” are used interchangeably. The term “online shopping” was invented much earlier in 1984.  Today the term primarily refers to the business-to-consumer transactional business. In order to enable “online shopping” a software system is needed. Since “online shopping”, in the context of the B2C business model, became broadly available to the end consumer, internet-based “online shops” evolved.
,
,Technical definition,[,edit,],
,These applications typically provide a means of capturing a client's payment information, but in the case of a ,credit card, they rely on the software module of the secure gateway provider, in conjunction with the secure ,payment gateway,, in order to conduct secure credit card transactions online.
,Some setup must be done in the ,HTML, code of the ,website,, and the shopping cart software must be installed on the ,server, which hosts the site, or on the ,secure server, which accepts sensitive ordering information. E-shopping carts are usually implemented using ,HTTP cookies, or ,query strings,. In most server based implementations however, data related to the shopping cart is kept in the session object and is accessed and manipulated on the fly, as the user selects different items from the cart. Later at the process of finalizing the transaction, the information is accessed and an order is generated against the selected item thus clearing the shopping cart.
,Although the most simple shopping carts strictly allow for an item to be added to a basket to start a checkout process (e.g., the free ,PayPal, shopping cart), most shopping cart software provides additional features that an Internet merchant uses to fully manage an online store. Data (products, categories, discounts, orders, customers, etc.) is normally stored in a ,database, and accessed in real time by the software.
,Shopping Cart Software is also known as e-commerce software, e-store software, online store software or storefront software and online shop.
,
,Components,[,edit,],
,Storefront,: the area of the Web store that is accessed by visitors to the online shop. Category, product, and other pages (e.g., search, bestsellers, etc.) are dynamically generated by the software based on the information saved in the store database. The look of the storefront can normally be changed by the store owner so that it merges with the rest of the web site (i.e., with the pages not controlled by the shopping cart software in use on the store).,
,Administration,: the area of the Web store that is accessed by the merchant to manage the online shop. The amount of store management features changes depending on the sophistication of the shopping cart software chosen by the merchant, but in general a store manager is able to add and edit products, categories, discounts, shipping and payment settings, etc. Order management features are also included in many shopping cart programs. The administration area can be:
,Web-based (accessed through a ,web browser,),
,Desktop-based (a desktop application that runs on the user's computer and then transfers changes to the storefront component).,
,Types,[,edit,],
,Shopping cart software can be generally categorized into three ,types of E-commerce, software:,[2],
,
,Open source software,: The software is released under an ,open source licence, and is very often free of charge. The merchant has to host the software with a ,Web hosting service,. It allows users to access and modify the source code of the entire online store.,
,Licensed software,:  The software is downloaded and then installed on a ,Webserver,. This is most often associated with a one-time fee, the main advantages of this option are that the merchant owns a license and therefore can host it on any web server that meets the server requirements.,
,Hosted service,: The software is never downloaded, but rather is provided by a ,hosted service provider, and is generally paid for on a monthly or annual basis; also known as the ,application service provider, (ASP) software model. Some of these services also charge a percentage of sales in addition to the monthly fee. This model often has predefined templates that a user can choose from to customize their look and feel. Predefined templates limit how much users can modify or customize the software with the advantage of having the vendor continuously keep the software up to date for ,security patch,es as well as adding new features.,
,PCI Compliance,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard,
,The PCI security standards are a blanket of regulations set in place to safeguard payment account data security.  The council that develops and monitors these regulations is composed of the leading providers in the payment industry:  ,American Express,, ,Discover Financial Services,, ,JCB International,, ,MasterCard Worldwide,, and ,Visa Inc,.  Essentially, they define the best practices for storing, transmitting, and handling of sensitive information over the internet.,[3],[,unreliable source?,],
,Visa Inc.can hold shopping cart software providers responsible for liability that may occur as a result of non-compliance to Visa's regulations. For this reason, Visa Inc. may require that online merchants use shopping cart software providers from their list of ,PCI DSS,-validated service providers.,[4],

,A ,network host, is a ,computer, or other device connected to a ,computer network,. A host may work as a ,server, offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other hosts on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one ,network address,.
,A computer participating in networks that use the ,Internet protocol suite, may also be called an ,IP host,. Specifically, computers participating in the ,Internet, are called ,Internet hosts,. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more ,IP addresses, assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at startup by means of the ,Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, (DHCP), or by ,stateless address autoconfiguration, methods.
,Network hosts that participate in applications that use the ,client–server model, of computing, are classified as ,server, or ,client, systems. Network hosts may also function as nodes in ,peer-to-peer, applications, in which all nodes share and consume resources in an equipotent manner.

,Origins,[,edit,],
,In ,operating systems,, the term ,terminal host, denotes a ,time-sharing, computer or ,multi-user software, providing services to ,computer terminals,, or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices,,[1], such as a ,mainframe computer, serving ,teletype, terminals or video terminals. Other examples of this architecture include a ,telnet, host connected to a telnet server and an ,xhost, connected to an ,X Window client,.
,The term ,Internet host, or just ,host, is used in a number of ,Request for Comments, (RFC) documents that define the Internet and its predecessor, the ,ARPANET,. ,RFC 871, defines a host as a general-purpose computer system connected to a communications network for ""... the purpose of achieving resource sharing amongst the participating operating systems..."",[2],
,While the ARPANET was being developed, computers connected to the network were typically mainframe computer systems that could be accessed from ,dumb terminals, connected via ,serial ports,. Since these terminals did not host software or perform computations themselves, they were not considered ,hosts, as they were not connected to any ,IP network,, and were not assigned IP addresses.
,
,Nodes, hosts, and servers,[,edit,],
,A ,network node, is any device participating in a network. A host is a node that participates is user applications, either as a server, client, or both. A ,server, is a type of host that offers resources to the other hosts. Typically a server accepts connections from ,clients, who request a service function.,[,citation needed,],
,Every network host is a node, but not every network node is a host. ,Network infrastructure hardware,, such as ,modems,, ,Ethernet hubs,, and ,network switches, are not directly or actively participating in application-level functions, and do not necessarily have a network address, and are not considered to be network hosts.

,In ,computing,, a ,directory, is a ,file system, cataloging structure which contains references to other ,computer files,, and possibly other directories. On many computers, directories are known as ,folders,, or ,drawers,,,[1], ,analogous, to a ,workbench, or the traditional office ,filing cabinet,.
,Files are organized by storing related files in the same directory. In a ,hierarchical, ,file system, (that is, one in which files and directories are organized in a manner that resembles a ,tree,), a directory contained inside another directory is called a ,subdirectory,.  The terms ,parent, and ,child, are often used to describe the relationship between a subdirectory and the directory in which it is cataloged, the latter being the parent. The top-most directory in such a filesystem, which does not have a parent of its own, is called the ,root, directory.

,Overview,[,edit,],
,  ,Diagram of a hierarchical directory tree. The root directory is here called ""MFD"", for Master File Directory., 
,Historically, and even on some modern ,embedded systems,, the file systems either had no support for directories at all, or only had a ""flat"" ,directory structure,, meaning subdirectories were not supported; there were only a group of top-level directories, each containing files. In modern systems, a directory can contain a mix of files and subdirectories.
,A reference to a location in a directory system is called a ,path,.
,In many ,operating systems,, programs have an associated ,working directory, in which they execute. Typically, file names accessed by the program are assumed to reside within this directory if the file names are not specified with an explicit directory name.
,Some operating systems restrict a ,user's, access to only their ,home directory, or project directory, thus isolating their activities from all other users. In early versions of Unix the root directory was the home directory of the ,root user,, but modern Unix usually uses another directory such as /root for this purpose.
,In keeping with ,Unix philosophy,, Unix systems treat directories as a type of file.,[2],
,
,Folder metaphor,[,edit,],
,  ,Sample folder icon (from ,KDE,).,
,The name ,folder,, presenting an analogy to the ,file folder, used in offices, and used in a hierarchical file system design for the ,Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting, (ERMA) Mark 1 published in 1958,[3], as well as by ,Xerox Star,,,[4], is used in almost all modern ,operating systems,' desktop environments. Folders are often depicted with ,icons, which visually resemble physical file folders.
,There is a difference between a ,directory,, which is a ,file system, concept, and the ,graphical user interface, metaphor that is used to represent it (a ,folder,).  For example, ,Microsoft Windows, uses the concept of ,special folders, to help present the contents of the computer to the user in a fairly consistent way that frees the user from having to deal with absolute directory paths, which can vary between versions of Windows, and between individual installations. Many operating systems also have the concept of ""smart folders"" or ,virtual folders, that reflect the results of a file system search or other operation. These folders do not represent a directory in the file hierarchy. Many ,email clients, allow the creation of folders to organize email. These folders have no corresponding representation in the filesystem structure.
,If one is referring to a ,container of documents,, the term ,folder, is more appropriate. The term ,directory, refers to the way a structured list of document files and folders are stored on the computer. The distinction can be due to the way a directory is accessed; on Unix systems, /usr/bin/ is usually referred to as a directory when viewed in a ,command line, ,console,, but if accessed through a graphical ,file manager,, users may sometimes call it a folder.
,
,Lookup cache,[,edit,],
,This section ,needs expansion,. ,You can help by ,adding to it,.,  ,(,December 2013,),
,Operating systems that support hierarchical filesystems (practically all modern ones) implement a form of ,caching, to ,RAM, of recent ,path, lookups. In the ,Unix, world, this is usually called ,Directory Name Lookup Cache, (DNLC), although it is called ,dcache, on ,Linux,.,[5],
,For local filesystems, DNLC entries normally expire only under pressure from other more recent entries. For ,network file systems, a ,coherence mechanism, is necessary to ensure that entries have not been invalidated by other clients.,[5],

,Charles Mingus Jr., (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American ,jazz, double bassist, pianist, composer and bandleader. A major proponent of collective ,improvisation,, he is considered to be one of the greatest jazz musicians and composers in history,,[1], with a career spanning three decades and collaborations with other jazz legends such as ,Louis Armstrong,, ,Duke Ellington,, ,Charlie Parker,, ,Dizzy Gillespie,, ,Dannie Richmond,, and ,Herbie Hancock,.
,Mingus' compositions continue to be played by contemporary musicians ranging from the repertory bands ,Mingus Big Band,, ,Mingus Dynasty,, and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition.,[2], In 1993, the ,Library of Congress, acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as ""the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history"".

,Biography,[,edit,],
,Early life and career,[,edit,],
,Charles Mingus was born in ,Nogales, Arizona,. His father, Charles Mingus Sr., was a sergeant in the U.S. Army.,[3], Mingus was largely raised in the ,Watts, area of Los Angeles. His maternal grandfather was a Chinese British subject from Hong Kong, and his maternal grandmother was an African-American from the southern United States. Mingus was the third great-grandson of the family's founding patriarch who was, by most accounts, a German immigrant. His ancestors included German American, African American, and Native American.,[4],[5],[6],
,In Mingus's autobiography ,Beneath the Underdog, his mother was described as ""the daughter of an English/Chinese man and a South-American woman"", and his father was the son ""of a black farm worker and a Swedish woman"". Charles Mingus Sr. claims to have been raised by his mother and her husband as a white person until he was fourteen, when his mother revealed to her family that the child's true father was a black slave, after which he had to run away from his family and live on his own. The autobiography does not confirm whether Charles Mingus Sr. or Mingus himself believed this story was true, or whether it was merely an embellished version of the Mingus family's lineage.,[7],
,His mother allowed only church-related music in their home, but Mingus developed an early love for other music, especially ,Duke Ellington,. He studied trombone, and later cello, although he was unable to follow the cello professionally because, at the time, it was nearly impossible for a black musician to make a career of classical music, and the cello was not yet accepted as a jazz instrument. Despite this, Mingus was still attached to the cello; as he studied bass with ,Red Callender, in the late 1930s, Callender even commented that the cello was still Mingus's main instrument. In ,Beneath the Underdog,, Mingus states that he did not actually start learning bass until ,Buddy Collette, accepted him into his swing band under the stipulation that he be the band's bass player.,[7],
,Due to a poor education, the young Mingus could not read musical notation quickly enough to join the local youth orchestra. This had a serious impact on his early musical experiences, leaving him feeling ostracized from the classical music world. These early experiences, in addition to his lifelong confrontations with racism, were reflected in his music, which often focused on themes of racism, discrimination and (in)justice.,[6],
,Much of the cello technique he learned was applicable to ,double bass, when he took up the instrument in high school. He studied for five years with ,Herman Reinshagen,, principal bassist of the ,New York Philharmonic,, and compositional techniques with Lloyd Reese.,[8], Throughout much of his career, he played a bass made in 1927 by the German maker ,Ernst Heinrich Roth,.
,Beginning in his teen years, Mingus was writing quite advanced pieces; many are similar to ,Third Stream, because they incorporate elements of classical music. A number of them were recorded in 1960 with conductor ,Gunther Schuller,, and released as ,Pre-Bird,, referring to ,Charlie ""Bird"" Parker,; Mingus was one of many musicians whose perspectives on music were altered by Parker into ""pre- and post-Bird"" eras.,[,citation needed,],
,Mingus gained a reputation as a bass prodigy. His first major professional job was playing with former Ellington clarinetist ,Barney Bigard,. He toured with ,Louis Armstrong, in 1943, and by early 1945 was recording in Los Angeles in a band led by ,Russell Jacquet,, which also included ,Teddy Edwards,, ,Maurice Simon,, ,Bill Davis,, and ,Chico Hamilton,, and in May that year, in Hollywood, again with Teddy Edwards, in a band led by ,Howard McGhee,.,[9],
,He then played with ,Lionel Hampton,'s band in the late 1940s; Hampton performed and recorded several of Mingus's pieces. A popular trio of Mingus, ,Red Norvo, and ,Tal Farlow, in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim, but Mingus's race caused problems with club owners and he left the group. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist ,Wendell Marshall,. Mingus's notorious temper led to his being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington (,Bubber Miley, and drummer ,Bobby Durham, are among the others), after a back-stage fight between Mingus and ,Juan Tizol,.,[10],
,Also in the early 1950s, before attaining commercial recognition as a bandleader, Mingus played gigs with ,Charlie Parker,, whose compositions and improvisations greatly inspired and influenced him. Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker's legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker's throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker's self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song, ""If ,Charlie Parker, were a Gunslinger, There'd be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats"" (released on ,Mingus Dynasty, as ""Gunslinging Bird"").,[,citation needed,],
,Mingus was married four times. His wives were Jeanne Gross, Lucille (Celia) Germanis, Judy Starkey, and Susan Graham Ungaro.,[4],
,
,Based in New York,[,edit,],
,In 1961, Mingus spent time staying at the house of his mother's sister (Louise) and her husband, ,Fess Williams, in Jamaica, Queens.,[11],  Subsequently, Mingus invited Williams to play at the 1962 Town Hall Concert.,[12],
,In 1952 Mingus co-founded ,Debut Records, with ,Max Roach, so he could conduct his recording career as he saw fit. The name originated from his desire to document unrecorded young musicians. Despite this, the best-known recording the company issued was of the most prominent figures in bebop. On May 15, 1953, Mingus joined ,Dizzy Gillespie,, Parker, ,Bud Powell,, and Roach for a concert at ,Massey Hall, in Toronto, which is the ,last recorded documentation, of Gillespie and Parker playing together. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in New York; the original version was issued later. The two 10"" albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any royalties ""for years and years"" for his Massey Hall appearance. The records, however, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings.
,One story has it that Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a 1955 club date billed as a ""reunion"" with Parker, Powell, and Roach. Powell, who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness (possibly exacerbated by a severe police beating and electroshock treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell's incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting ""Bud Powell...Bud Powell..."" as if beseeching Powell's return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell's departure, to his own amusement and Mingus's exasperation. Mingus took another microphone and announced to the crowd, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please don't associate me with any of this. This is not jazz.  These are sick people."",[11], This was Parker's last public performance; about a week later he died after years of substance abuse.
,Mingus often worked with a mid-sized ensemble (around 8–10 members) of rotating musicians known as the ,Jazz Workshop,. Mingus broke new ground, constantly demanding that his musicians be able to explore and develop their perceptions on the spot. Those who joined the Workshop (or Sweatshops as they were colorfully dubbed by the musicians) included ,Pepper Adams,, ,Jaki Byard,, ,Booker Ervin,, ,John Handy,, ,Jimmy Knepper,, ,Charles McPherson, and ,Horace Parlan,. Mingus shaped these musicians into a cohesive improvisational machine that in many ways anticipated ,free jazz,. Some musicians dubbed the workshop a ""university"" for jazz.
,
,Pithecanthropus Erectus, and other recordings,[,edit,],
,The decade that followed  is generally regarded as Mingus's most productive and fertile period. Over a ten-year period, he made 30 records for a number of labels (,Atlantic,, ,Candid,, ,Columbia,, ,Impulse, and others), a pace perhaps unmatched by any other musicians except Ellington.,[,citation needed,],
,Mingus had already recorded around ten albums as a bandleader, but 1956 was a breakthrough year for him, with the release of ,Pithecanthropus Erectus,, arguably his first major work as both a bandleader and composer. Like Ellington, Mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind, and his band for ,Erectus, included adventurous musicians: piano player ,Mal Waldron,, alto saxophonist ,Jackie McLean, and the ,Sonny Rollins,-influenced tenor of ,J. R. Monterose,. The title song is a ten-minute ,tone poem,, depicting the rise of man from his ,hominid, roots (,Pithecanthropus erectus,) to an eventual downfall. A section of the piece was ,free improvisation,, free of structure or theme.
,Another album from this period, ,The Clown, (1957 also on ,Atlantic Records,), the title track of which features narration by humorist ,Jean Shepherd,, was the first to feature drummer ,Dannie Richmond,, who remained his preferred drummer until Mingus's death in 1979. The two men formed one of the most impressive and versatile ,rhythm sections, in jazz. Both were accomplished performers seeking to stretch the boundaries of their music while staying true to its roots. When joined by pianist ,Jaki Byard,, they were dubbed ""The Almighty Three"".,[13],
,
,Mingus Ah Um, and other works,[,edit,],
,In 1959 Mingus and his jazz workshop musicians recorded one of his best-known albums, ,Mingus Ah Um,. Even in a year of standout masterpieces, including ,Dave Brubeck,'s ,Time Out,, ,Miles Davis,'s ,Kind of Blue,, ,John Coltrane,'s ,Giant Steps,, and ,Ornette Coleman,'s prophetic ,The Shape of Jazz to Come,, this was a major achievement, featuring such classic Mingus compositions as ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" (an elegy to ,Lester Young,) and the vocal-less version of ""Fables of Faubus"" (a protest against segregationist Arkansas governor ,Orval Faubus, that features double-time sections). Also during 1959, Mingus recorded the album ,Blues & Roots,, which was released the following year. As Mingus explained in his liner notes: ""I was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy, but I've grown up and I like to do things other than just swing. But blues can do more than just swing.""
,Mingus witnessed ,Ornette Coleman,'s legendary—and controversial—1960 appearances at New York City's ,Five Spot, jazz club. He initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman's innovative music: ""...if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice, then I would say they were playing something...Most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they don't even know what's going to come out. They're experimenting."" That same year, however, Mingus formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter ,Ted Curson, and multi-instrumentalist ,Eric Dolphy,. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman's quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. The quartet recorded on both ,Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus, and ,Mingus,.  The former also features the version of ""Fables of Faubus"" with lyrics, aptly titled ""Original Faubus Fables"".
,Only one misstep occurred in this era: ,The Town Hall Concert, in October 1962, a ""live workshop""/recording session. With an ambitious program, the event was plagued with troubles from its inception.,[14], Mingus's vision, now known as ,Epitaph,, was finally realized by conductor ,Gunther Schuller, in a concert in 1989, a decade after Mingus died.
,
,The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, and other Impulse! albums,[,edit,],
,In 1963, Mingus released ,The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady,, described as ""one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history."",[15], The album was also unique in that Mingus asked his psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock, to provide notes for the record.
,Mingus also released ,Mingus Plays Piano,, an unaccompanied album featuring some fully improvised pieces, in 1963.
,In addition, 1963 saw the release of ,Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus,, an album  praised by critic ,Nat Hentoff,.,[16],
,In 1964 Mingus put together one of his best-known groups, a sextet including ,Dannie Richmond,, ,Jaki Byard,, ,Eric Dolphy,, trumpeter ,Johnny Coles,, and tenor saxophonist ,Clifford Jordan,. The group was recorded frequently during its short existence; Coles fell ill and left during a European tour. Dolphy stayed in Europe after the tour ended, and died suddenly in Berlin on June 28, 1964. 1964 was also the year that Mingus met his future wife, ,Sue Graham Ungaro,. The couple were married in 1966 by ,Allen Ginsberg,.,[17], Facing financial hardship, Mingus was evicted from his New York home in 1966.
,
,Changes,[,edit,],
,Mingus's pace slowed somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, after his 1970 sextet with Charles McPherson, Eddie Preston and Bobby Jones disbanded, he formed a quintet with Richmond, pianist ,Don Pullen,, trumpeter ,Jack Walrath, and saxophonist ,George Adams,. They recorded two well-received albums, ,Changes One, and ,Changes Two,. Mingus also played with ,Charles McPherson, in many of his groups during this time. ,Cumbia and Jazz Fusion, in 1976 sought to blend Colombian music (the "",Cumbia,"" of the title) with more traditional jazz forms. In 1971, Mingus taught for a semester at the ,University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, as the Slee Professor of Music.,[18],
,
,Later career and death,[,edit,],
,By the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from ,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS). His once formidable bass technique declined until he could no longer play the instrument. He continued composing, however, and supervised a number of recordings before his death. At the time of his death, he was working with ,Joni Mitchell, on an album eventually titled ,Mingus,, which included lyrics added by Mitchell to his compositions, including "",Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,"". The album featured the talents of ,Wayne Shorter,, ,Herbie Hancock,, and another influential bassist and composer, ,Jaco Pastorius,.
,Mingus died, aged 56, in ,Cuernavaca,, ,Mexico,, where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the ,Ganges River,.
,
,Musical style,[,edit,],
,His compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of ,hard bop,, drawing heavily from black ,gospel music, and ,blues,, while sometimes containing elements of ,Third Stream,, ,free jazz,, and ,classical music,. He once cited ,Duke Ellington, and church as his main influences.
,Mingus espoused collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, he looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists, whom he utilized to assemble unconventional instrumental configurations. As a performer, Mingus was a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument's most proficient players.
,Because of his brilliant writing for midsize ensembles, and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups, Mingus is often considered the heir of ,Duke Ellington,, for whom he expressed great admiration and collaborated on the record ,Money Jungle,. Indeed, ,Dizzy Gillespie, had once claimed Mingus reminded him ""of a young Duke"", citing their shared ""organizational genius."",[19],
,
,Personality and temper,[,edit,],
,Nearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus's often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname ""The Angry Man of Jazz"". His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many onstage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals.,[20], Although respected for his musical talents, Mingus was sometimes feared for his occasionally violent onstage temper, which was at times directed at members of his band and other times aimed at the audience.,[21], He was physically large, prone to obesity (especially in his later years), and was by all accounts often intimidating and frightening when expressing anger or displeasure. When confronted with a nightclub audience talking and clinking ice in their glasses while he performed, Mingus stopped his band and loudly chastised the audience, stating: "",Isaac Stern, doesn't have to put up with this shit."",[22], Mingus reportedly destroyed a $20,000 bass in response to audience heckling at the Five Spot in New York City.,[23],
,Guitarist and singer ,Jackie Paris, was a first-hand witness to Mingus's irascibility. Paris recalls his time in the Jazz Workshop: ""He chased everybody off the stand except [drummer] ,Paul Motian, and me... The three of us just wailed on the blues for about an hour and a half before he called the other cats back."",[24],
,On October 12, 1962, Mingus punched ,Jimmy Knepper, in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus' apartment on a score for his upcoming concert at ,The Town Hall, in New York, and Knepper refused to take on more work. Mingus' blow broke off a crowned tooth and its underlying stub.,[25], According to Knepper, this ruined his ,embouchure, and resulted in the permanent loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone – a significant handicap for any professional trombonist. This attack temporarily ended their working relationship, and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. Knepper did again work with Mingus in 1977 and played extensively with the ,Mingus Dynasty,, formed after Mingus' death in 1979.,[26],
,In addition to bouts of ill temper, Mingus was prone to ,clinical depression, and tended to have brief periods of extreme creative activity intermixed with fairly long stretches of greatly decreased output, such as the five-year period following the death of Eric Dolphy.,[27],
,In 1966, Mingus was evicted from his apartment at 5 Great Jones Street in New York City for nonpayment of rent, captured in the 1968 ,documentary film, ,Mingus: Charlie Mingus 1968,, directed by Thomas Reichman. The film also features Mingus performing in clubs and in the apartment, firing a ,.410 shotgun, indoors, composing at the piano, playing with and taking care of his young daughter Caroline, and discussing love, art, politics, and the music school he had hoped to create.,[28],
,
,Legacy,[,edit,],
,The Mingus Big Band,[,edit,],
,Charles Mingus' music is currently being performed and reinterpreted by the ,Mingus Big Band,, which in October 2008 began playing every Monday at Jazz Standard in New York City, and often tours the rest of the U.S. and Europe. The ,Mingus Big Band,, the Mingus Orchestra, and the ,Mingus Dynasty, band are managed by Jazz Workshop, Inc. and run by Mingus' widow Sue Graham Mingus.
,Elvis Costello, has written lyrics for a few Mingus pieces. He had once sung lyrics for one piece, ""Invisible Lady"", backed by the Mingus Big Band on the album, ,Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love,.,[29],
,
,Epitaph,[,edit,],
,Epitaph, is considered one of Charles Mingus' masterpieces. The composition is 4,235 measures long, requires two hours to perform, and is one of the longest jazz pieces ever written. ,Epitaph, was only completely discovered, by musicologist Andrew Homzy, during the cataloging process after Mingus' death. With the help of a grant from the ,Ford Foundation,, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by ,Gunther Schuller,. This concert was produced by Mingus' widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at ,Alice Tully Hall, on June 3, 1989, 10 years after Mingus' death. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007. The performance at Walt Disney Concert Hall is available on NPR. Hal Leonard published the complete score in 2008.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Autobiography,[,edit,],
,Mingus wrote the sprawling, exaggerated, quasi-autobiography, ,Beneath the Underdog: His World as Composed by Mingus,,,[7], throughout the 1960s, and it was published in 1971. Its "",stream of consciousness,"" style covered several aspects of his life that had previously been off-record. In addition to his musical and intellectual proliferation, Mingus goes into great detail about his perhaps overstated sexual exploits. He claims to have had more than 31 affairs in the course of his life (including 26 prostitutes in one sitting). This does not include any of his five wives (he claims to have been married to two of them simultaneously). In addition, he asserts that he held a brief career as a pimp. This has never been confirmed.
,Mingus's autobiography also serves as an insight into his psyche, as well as his attitudes about race and society.,[30], It includes accounts of abuse at the hands of his father from an early age, being bullied as a child, his removal from a white musician's union, and grappling with disapproval while married to white women and other examples of the hardship and prejudice.,[31],
,
,Scholarly influence,[,edit,],
,The work of Charles Mingus has also received attention in academia. According to Ashon Crawley, the musicianship of Charles Mingus provides a salient example of the power of music to unsettle the dualistic, categorical distinction of sacred from profane through otherwise epistemologies.,[32], Crawley offers a reading of Mingus that examines the deep, imbrication uniting Holiness-Pentecostal aesthetic practices and jazz. Mingus recognized the importance and impact of the midweek gathering of black folks at the Holiness-Pentecostal Church at 79th and Watts in Los Angeles that he'd attend with his stepmother or his friend Britt Woodman. Crawley goes on to argue that these visits were the impetus for the song ""Wednesday Prayer Meeting."" Emphasis is placed on the ethical demand of the prayer meeting felt and experienced that, according to Crawley, Mingus attempts to capture. In many ways, ""Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting"" was Mingus's memorial, homage, to black sociality. By exploring Mingus' homage to black Pentecostal aesthetics, Crawley expounds on how Mingus figured out that those Holiness-Pentecostal gatherings were the constant repetition of the ongoing, deep, intense mode of study, a kind of study wherein the aesthetic forms created could not be severed from the intellectual practice because they were one and also, but not, the same."" ,Gunther Schuller, has suggested that Mingus should be ranked among the most important American composers, jazz or otherwise. In 1988, a grant from the ,National Endowment for the Arts,[33], made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the ,New York Public Library,[34], for public use. In 1993, ,The Library of Congress, acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as ""the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history"".,[35],
,
,Cover versions,[,edit,],
,Considering the number of compositions that Charles Mingus wrote, his works have not been recorded as often as comparable jazz composers. The only Mingus tribute albums recorded during his lifetime were baritone saxophonist ,Pepper Adams,'s album, ,Pepper Adams Plays the Compositions of Charlie Mingus,, in 1963, and ,Joni Mitchell,'s album ,Mingus,, in 1979. Of all his works, his elegant elegy for ,Lester Young,, "",Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,"" (from ,Mingus Ah Um,) has probably had the most recordings. Besides recordings from the expected jazz artists, the song has also been recorded by musicians as disparate as ,Jeff Beck,, ,Andy Summers,, ,Eugene Chadbourne,, and ,Bert Jansch, and ,John Renbourn, with and without ,Pentangle,. ,Joni Mitchell, sang a version with lyrics that she wrote for it.
,Elvis Costello, has recorded ""Hora Decubitus"" (from ,Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus,) on ,My Flame Burns Blue, (2006). ""Better Git It in Your Soul"" was covered by ,Davey Graham, on his album ""Folk, Blues, and Beyond."" Trumpeter Ron Miles performs a version of ""Pithecanthropus Erectus"" on his CD ""Witness."" New York Ska Jazz Ensemble has done a cover of Mingus's ""Haitian Fight Song"", as have the British folk rock group Pentangle and others. ,Hal Willner,'s 1992 tribute album ,Weird Nightmare: Meditations on Mingus, (,Columbia Records,) contains idiosyncratic renditions of Mingus's works involving numerous popular musicians including ,Chuck D,, ,Keith Richards,, ,Henry Rollins, and ,Dr. John,. The Italian band ,Quintorigo, recorded an entire album devoted to Mingus's music, titled ,Play Mingus,.
,Gunther Schuller,'s edition of Mingus's ""Epitaph"" which premiered at ,Lincoln Center, in 1989 was subsequently released on Columbia/Sony Records.
,One of the most elaborate tributes to Mingus came on September 29, 1969, at a festival honoring him. ,Duke Ellington, performed ,The Clown,, with Duke reading ,Jean Shepherd,'s narration. It was long believed that no recording of this performance existed; however, one was discovered and premiered on July 11, 2013, by Dry River Jazz host ,Trevor Hodgkins, for NPR member station KRWG-FM with re-airings on July 13, 2013, and July 26, 2014.,[36], Mingus's elegy for Duke, ""Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love"", was recorded by ,Kevin Mahogany, on ,Double Rainbow, (1993) and ,Anita Wardell, on ,Why Do You Cry?, (1995).

,Fullfeatured hosting process,[,edit,],
,Full-featured hosting services include:
,
,Complex managed hosting, applies to both physical dedicated servers and virtual servers, with many companies choosing a hybrid (a combination of physical and virtual) hosting solution. There are many similarities between standard and complex managed hosting but the key difference is the level of administrative and engineering support that the customer pays for – owing to both the increased size and complexity of the infrastructure deployment. The provider steps in to take over most of the management, including security, memory, storage and IT support. The service is primarily proactive in nature. ,[1],
,Dedicated hosting service,, also called managed hosting service, where the hosting service provider owns and manages the machine, leasing full control to the client.  Management of the server can include monitoring to ensure the server continues to work effectively, backup services, installation of security patches and various levels of technical support.,
,Virtual private server,, in which virtualization technology is employed in order to allow multiple logical servers to run on a single physical server,
,Colocation facilities, provide just the Internet connection, uninterruptible power, and climate control, but let the client do his own ,system administration,; the most expensive,
,Cloud hosting,, which can also be termed time-share or on-demand hosting, in which the user only pays for the system time and space used, and capacity can be quickly scaled up or down as computing requirements change.,
,Other,[,edit,],
,Limited or application-specific hosting services include:,[,citation needed,],
,
,File hosting service,
,Web hosting service,
,E-mail hosting service,
,DNS hosting service,
,Game servers,
,Wiki farms,
,Bandwidth cost,[,edit,],
,Internet hosting services include the required Internet connection; they may charge a flat rate per month or charge per bandwidth used — a common payment plan is to sell a predetermined amount of bandwidth and charge for any 'overage' (Usage above the predetermined limit) the customer may incur on a per GB basis. The overage charge would be agreed upon at the start of the contract.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Patent dispute,[,edit,],
,Web hosting technology has been causing some controversy, as ,Web.com, claims that it holds patent rights to some common hosting technologies, including the use of a web-based control panel to manage the hosting service, with its 19 patents. Hostopia, a large wholesale hosting provider, purchased a license to use that technology from Web.com for 10% of Hostopia's retail revenues. In addition, Web.com sued ,GoDaddy, as well for similar patent infringement.,[2],

" 20 May 2020, at 14:15","Software system that serves the delivery of learning content and the organisation of learning processes,
,
A ,learning management system, (,LMS,) is a ,software application, for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation and delivery of ,educational, courses, training programs, or learning and development programs.,[1], The learning management system concept emerged directly from ,e-Learning,. Although the first LMS appeared in the higher education sector, the majority of the LMSs today focus on the corporate market. Learning Management Systems make up the largest segment of the learning system market. The first introduction of the LMS was in the late 1990s.,[2],
,Learning management systems were designed to identify training and learning gaps, utilizing analytical data and reporting. LMSs are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based and synchronous based. An LMS may offer classroom management for instructor-led training or a flipped ,classroom,, used in higher education, but not in the ,corporate, space. Modern LMSs include intelligent algorithms to make automated recommendations for courses based on a user's skill profile as well as extract meta-data from learning materials in order to make such recommendations even more accurate.

,Characteristics,[,edit,],
,Purpose,[,edit,],
,An LMS delivers and manages all types of content, including video, courses, and documents. In the education and higher education markets, an LMS will include a variety of functionality that is similar to corporate but will have features such as rubrics, teacher and instructor facilitated learning, a discussion board, and often the use of a syllabus. A syllabus is rarely a feature in the corporate LMS, although courses may start with heading-level index to give learners an overview of topics covered.
,
,History,[,edit,],
,There are several historical phases of distance education that preceded the development of the LMS:
,
,Correspondence teaching,[,edit,],
,The first known document of correspondence teaching dates back to 1723, through the advertisement in the ,Boston Gazette, of Caleb Phillips, professor of ,shorthand,, offering teaching materials and tutorials.,[3], The first testimony of a bi-directional communication organized correspondence course comes from England, in 1840, when ,Isaac Pitman, initiated a shorthand course, wherein he sent a passage of the Bible to students, who would send it back in full transcription. The success of the course resulted in the foundation of the phonographic correspondence society in 1843. The pioneering milestone in distance language teaching was in 1856 by Charles Toussaint and ,Gustav Langenscheidt,, who began the first European institution of distance learning. This is the first known instance of the use of materials for independent language study.,[4], Correspondence institutions in the United States and across ,Europe, were encouraged and fostered by the development in 1680 of the penny post service, which allowed the delivery of letters and parcels for a penny.,[5],
,
,Multimedia teaching: The emergence and development of the distance learning idea,[,edit,],
,The concept of ,eLearning, began developing in the early 20th century, marked by the appearance of audio-video communication systems used for remote teaching.,[6], In 1909, ,E.M. Forster, published his story 'The Machine Stops' and explained the benefits of using audio communication to deliver lectures to remote audiences.,[7],
,In 1920, ,Sidney L. Pressey, developed the first teaching machine which offered multiple types of practical exercises and question formats. Nine years later, ,University of Alberta,'s Professor M.E. Zerte transformed this machine into a problem cylinder able to compare problems and solutions.,[8],
,This, in a sense was ""multimedia"", because it made use of several media to reach students and provide instruction. Later printed materials would be joined by telephone, radio and TV broadcasts, audio and video tapes.,[9],
,The earliest networked learning system was the ,Plato, Learning Management system (PLM) developed in the 1970s by Control Data Corporation.
,
,Telematic Teaching,[,edit,],
,In the 1980s the modern telecommunications start to be used in education, with computers more present in the daily use of higher education institutions. Computer aided teaching aim to integrate technical and educational means and instruments to student learning. The trend then shifted to video communication, as a result of which ,Houston University, decided to hold telecast classes to their students for approximately 13–15 hours a week. The classes took place in 1953, while in 1956, Robin McKinnon Wood and Gordon Pask released the very first adaptive teaching system for corporate environments SAKI.,[10], The idea of automating teaching operations also inspired the University of Illinois experts to develop their ,Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations (PLATO), which enabled users to exchange content regardless of their location.,[10], In the period between 1970 and 1980, educational venues were rapidly considering the idea of computerizing courses, including the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute from California that introduced the first accredited online-taught degree.
,
,Teaching through the internet: The appearance of the first LMS system,[,edit,],
,The history of the application of computers to education is filled with broadly descriptive terms such as ,computer-managed instruction, (CMI), and ,integrated learning systems, (ILS), computer-based instruction (CBI), ,computer-assisted instruction, (CAI), and ,computer-assisted learning, (CAL). These terms describe drill-and-practice programs, more sophisticated tutorials, and more individualized instruction, respectively.,[11], The term is currently used to describe a number of different educational ,computer applications,.,[12], ,FirstClass, by SoftArc, used by the United Kingdom's ,Open University, in the 1990s and 2000s to deliver online learning across Europe, was one of the earliest internet-based LMSs.,[13],[14],
,The first fully featured Learning Management System (LMS) was called ,EKKO,, developed and released by Norway's NKI Distance Education Network in 1991.,[15], Three years later, ,New Brunswick,'s NB Learning Network presented a similar system designed for DOS-based teaching, and devoted exclusively to business learners.
,
,Technical aspects,[,edit,],
,Most modern LMSs are web-based. There are a variety of integration strategies for embedding content into LMSs, including AICC, xAPI (also called 'Tin Can'), SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model),[16], and LTI (,Learning Tools Interoperability,). LMSs were originally designed to be locally hosted on-premise, where the organization purchases a license to a version of the software, and installs it on their own servers and network. Many LMSs are now offered as ,SaaS, (software as a service), with hosting provided by the vendors.,[17],
,Through LMS, teachers may create and integrate course materials, articulate learning goals, align content and assessments, track studying progress, and create customized test for students. LMS allows the communication of learning objectives, and organize learning timelines. LMS leverage is that it delivers learning content and tools straight to learners, and it can also reach marginalized groups through special settings. Such systems have built in customizable features including assessment and tracking. Thus, learners can see in real time their progress and instructors can monitor and communicate the effectiveness of learning.,[18],[19], One of the most important features of LMS is trying to create a streamline communication between learners and instructors. Such systems, besides facilitating online learning, tracking learning progress, providing digital learning tools, manage communication, and maybe selling content, may be used to provide different communication features.,[20],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Managing courses, users and roles,[,edit,],
,The LMS may be used to create professional structured course content. The teacher can add, text, images, tables, links and text formatting, interactive tests, slideshows etc. Moreover, you can create different types of users, such as teachers, students, parents, visitors and editors (hierarchies). It helps control which content a student can access, track studying progress and engage student with contact tools. Teachers can manage courses and modules, enroll students or set up self-enrollment, see reports on students and import students to their online classes.,[21],
,With much of the integration of new resources being controlled by technical guidelines outlined by SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model), the process of integrating new features within multiple LMSs has become more efficient.
,
,Online assessment and tracking students' attendance,[,edit,],
,LMS can enable teachers to create customized tests for students, accessible and submitted online. Platforms allow different multiple question types such as: one/multi-line answer; multiple choice answer; drag-and-drop order; essay; true or false/yes or no; fill in the gaps; agreement scale and offline tasks. Some LMSs also allow for attendance management and integration with classroom training wherein administrators can view attendance and records of whether a learner attended, arrived late, or missed classes and events.,[18],
,
,User feedback,[,edit,],
,Students' exchange of feedback both with teachers and their peers is possible through LMS. Teachers may create discussion groups to allow students feedback and increase the interaction in course. Students' feedback is an instrument which help teachers to improve their work, identify what to add or remove from their courses, where students feel more comfortable, what makes them be more included.,[2],
,
,Learning management industry,[,edit,],
,In the U.S. higher education market as of fall 2018, the top three LMSs by number of institutions were ,Blackboard, (31%), ,Canvas, (30%), and ,Moodle, (18%).,[22], The same three systems led in terms of number of students enrolled, but Canvas slightly surpassed Blackboard. Worldwide, the picture is different, with ,Moodle, having over 50% of market share in Europe, Latin America, and Oceania.,[23],
,Many users of LMSs use an ,authoring tool, to create content, which is then hosted on an LMS. In some cases, LMSs that do utilise a standard include a primitive authoring tool for basic content manipulation. More modern systems, in particular SAAS solutions have decided to not adopt a standard and have rich course authoring tools. There are several standards for creating and integrating complex content into an LMS, including ,AICC,, ,SCORM,, ,xAPI, and Learning Tools Interoperability. However, utilising SCORM or an alternative standardised course protocol is not always required and can be restrictive when used unnecessarily.,[24],
,Evaluation of LMSs is a complex task and significant research supports different forms of evaluation, including iterative processes where ,students' experiences and approaches to learning, are evaluated.,[25],
,
,Advantages and disadvantages,[,edit,],
,Advantages,[,edit,],
,There are six major advantages of LMS: interoperability, accessibility, reusability, durability, maintenance ability and adaptability, which in themselves constitute the concept of LMS.,[18],
,Other advantages include:
,
,An LMS supports content in various formats: text, video, audio, etc.,
,One can access materials anytime, from everywhere, teachers can modify the content, and students can see the updated material.,
,The evaluation of students is easier and fair, based on student attendance and online quizzes.,
,Students and teachers can re-use the material every time they need.,[26],
,Students can learn collaboratively by setting up ,a School website, with the LMS software and helps "",Keeps organizations up-to-date with compliance regulations., If your organization must stay up-to-date with current ,compliance regulations,, then a Learning Management System can be an invaluable tool. Compliance laws change on a regular basis, and updating a traditional course to reflect these changes can be a time-consuming chore.,
,Disadvantages,[,edit,],
,Although there are many advantages of LMS, authors have identified some disadvantages of using this system.
,
,Implementing LMS requires a well-built technology infrastructure. Teachers have to be willing to adapt their curricula from face to face lectures to online lectures.,[21], ,

,Roles and function,[,edit,],
,The many different uses of digital signage allow a business to accomplish a variety of goals. Some of the most common applications include:
,
,Public information, – news, weather, traffic and local (location specific) information, such as building directory with a map, fire exits and traveler information.,
,Internal information, - corporate messages, such as health & safety items, news and so forth.,
,Product information, – pricing, photos, raw materials or ingredients, suggested applications and other product information - especially useful in ,food marketing, where signage may include nutritional facts or suggested uses or recipes.,
,Information to enhance the customer service experience, - interpretive signage in museums, galleries, zoos, parks and gardens, exhibitions, tourist and cultural attractions.,[3],
,Advertising and Promotion, – promoting products or services, may be related to the location of the sign or using the screen's audience reach for general advertising.,
,Brand building, – in-store digital sign to promote the brand and build a brand identity.,
,Influencing customer behavior, – navigation, directing customers to different areas, increasing the ""dwell time"" on the store premises and a wide range of other uses in service of such influence.,
,Influencing product or brand decision-making, - Signage at the point of sale designed to influence choice e.g. Signage to help shoppers to choose dresses inside a fashion store,[4], or devices that on a computerized shopping trolley helping the customer locate products, check prices, access product information and manage shopping lists.,[5],
,Enhancing customer experience, – applications include the reduction of perceived wait time in the waiting areas of restaurants and other retail operations, bank queues, and similar circumstances, as well as demonstrations, such as those of recipes in food stores, among other examples.,[6],
,Navigation, – with interactive screens (in the floor, for example, as with ""informational footsteps"" found in some tourist attractions, museums and the like) or with other means of ""dynamic wayfinding"".,
,Reservations, – small, interactive screens on walls or desks that allow employees to reserve the space for a limited time and integrate with a room and resource scheduling platform.,
,Industry overview,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(,January 2020,),
,Over 200 different companies worldwide market digital signage solutions,[,buzzword,],[7], and the number is still consistently growing. With the influx of digital signage providers, the digital signage market is expected to grow upward to US$21.92 Billion by 2020, with a ,CAGR, of 8.04% from 2015 to 2020. The reason for the rise is due to the growing demand by companies for the development of digital signage solutions,[,buzzword,],, advertisement displays and paper wastage reduction.,[8], Presently,,[,when?,], North America dominates the digital signage market and will be expected to continue dominating the market until 2020, with the US occupying a majority of the market share. The Asia Pacific and European region has shown promise, with Germany and UK in Europe, and Japan and South Korea in the Asia Pacific region. These four countries are expected to have the highest rate of growth by 2020.,[9], The predominant market users of digital signage are restaurants,,[10], ,retailers,,,[11], office buildings,,[12], regional state and local planning authorities, public transport services,,[13], and various different industries.
,
,Restaurants,[,edit,],
,Digital signage is used in restaurants through an interactive menu screen that rotates promotional offers. Restaurants use digital signage both indoors and outdoors, with the latter needing a form,[14], of weather protection depending on the components of the hardware. Outdoor usage of digital signage is most prevalent in drive-through that allows the customer to browse through the entire menu at a glance while also placing their order with an interactive touchscreen.,[15], Indoor digital signage is used for the display of menus. Prior to the integration of digital signage, restaurants manually updated the cafeteria menu, which is in itself a full-time job, especially if the menu is updated daily. With digital signage, restaurants do not have to manually update the menu feed, with live menu feed from digital signage solutions.,[,buzzword,],[16], According to a survey conducted by quick-service restaurants and casual restaurant operators, over 20% of restaurant operators experience a 5% sales lift after incorporating digital signage in their service sectors.,[17],
,
,Shopping malls,[,edit,],
,Digital signage is widely used in shopping malls as a form of directory or map display. Uses of digital signage include a ,wayfinding, kiosk, enabling the customer to find their path through an interactive touchscreen. Recent digital signage have begun combining interactive advertisement with wayfinding application. This will offer shoppers who interact with the advertisement of the tenant in the shopping mall to the store. Another usage is disseminating relevant information such as the schedule of an event or campaign.,[18],
,
,Campaigns,[,edit,],
,Digital signage is used during exhibitions or marketing events to entice passersby. Digital signage aims to attract crowds to events and enhance visitor experience by making the experience memorable. Exhibitions use digital signage to create branding experiences.,[19], A recent campaign promoting the release of ,The Emoji Movie, used a digital signage kiosk to allow guests to interact with various emoji characters via the windows outside and inside of the party.,[20],
,
,Hospitality,[,edit,],
,The hospitality industry uses digital signage to display crucial information at a convenient and visible location for all its patron. A digital signage is capable of functioning as a virtual concierge in hotels and as entertainment for conferences during waiting room.,[21], Digital signage is also used in hotels as a form of wayfinding, to guide a large group of people for a conference to the correct room. Digital signage is used to provide a simple method to update information that is continuously changing such as expo information.,[22],
,
,Cinema,[,edit,],
,Digital signage is placed in the lobby, concession stands and displays advertisement before the movie begins. This informs customers about other theater offerings and scheduling, increasing concession sales and gaining other sources of revenue.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Transport,[,edit,],
,Transport is a growing sector for digital signage with practical solutions, such as ,wayfinding,, as well as out-of-home advertising.
,
,Personalized digital content,[,edit,],
,One specific use of digital signage is for ,out-of-home advertising, in which video content, advertisements, and/or messages are displayed on digital signs with the goal of delivering targeted messages, to specific locations and/or consumers, at specific times. This is often called ""digital out of home"" (DOOH).,[23],[24],
,
,Education,[,edit,],
,Digital signage can be used for school cafeteria menu boards, digitized noticeboards, and as an element of smart campuses. The University of Minnesota has installed 300 digital signage boards, updated with real-time data.,[25],
,
,Technologies,[,edit,],
,Interactivity,[,edit,],
,Interactive digital signage allows end users to interact with digital content via ,touchscreens,, body sensors or ,QR codes, via smartphones.,[26],
,Digital signs can interact with mobile phones using ,SMS, messaging and ,Bluetooth,. SMS can be used to post messages on the displays, while Bluetooth allows users to interact directly with what they see on screen. In addition to mobile interactivity, networks are also using technology that integrates social and location-based media interactivity. This technology enables end users to upload photos and messages to social networks as well as text messages.
,The widespread use of smartphones led to the development of ,screen–smart device interaction, technologies. These allow smartphone users to interact directly with the digital signage screen, for example, participate in a poll, play a game, or share social network content. JPEG images and MPEG4 videos remain the dominant digital content formats for the digital signage industry. For interactive content, ,HTML5, and ,Unity3D, are widely used due to their popularity among web developers and multimedia designers.
,
,Context-aware digital signage,[,edit,],
,Context-aware digital signage leverages technologies such as sensors, cameras, beacons, RFID technologies, software programs and network connectivity including the ,Internet of Things, (IoT) to monitor the ambient environment, process information and deliver promotional messages based on environmental cues.,[27], Many digital signage products include cameras and gather shopper demographic data by estimating the age, gender and economic status of passers-by and use this information to update signage as well as to provide back-end analytics and shopper profiles.
,
,Equipment and network infrastructure,[,edit,],
,  ,Digital signage in a pharmacy store,
,Digital signs rely on a variety of hardware to deliver the content. The components of a typical digital sign installation include one or more display screens, one or more ,media players,, and a content management server. Sometimes two or more of these components are present in a single device but typically there is a display screen, a media player, and a content management server that is connected to the media player over a network. One content management server may support multiple media players and one media player may support multiple screens. Stand-alone digital sign devices combine all three functions in one device and no network connection is needed. Digital signage media players run on a variety of operating systems including Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. 
,
,  ,Mock up report of the usage of digital signage.,
,LCD and LED displays,[,edit,],
,Rapidly dropping prices for large plasma and LCD screens have led to a growing increase in the number of digital sign installations.,[28], An array of these displays is known as a ,video wall,.
,Digital signage displays use ,content management systems, and ,digital media distribution systems, which can either be run from personal computers and servers or regional/national media hosting providers. In many digital sign applications, content must be regularly updated to ensure that the correct messages are being displayed. This can either be done manually as and when needed, through a scheduling system, using a ,data feed, from a content provider (e.g. ,Canadian Press,, Data Call Technologies, ,Bloomberg LP,, ,Thomson Reuters,, ,AHN,), or an in-house data source.
,Whenever the display, media player and content server are located apart there is a need for audio-video wiring between the display and the media player and between the media player and the content server. The connection from media player to display is normally a ,VGA,, ,DVI,, ,HDMI, or ,Component video, connection. Sometimes this signal is distributed over ,Cat 5 cables, using transmitter and receiver ,baluns, allowing for greater distances between display and player and simplified wiring. The connection from media player to the content server is usually a wired ,Ethernet, connection although some installations use wireless ,Wifi, networking.
,
,Usage reporting,[,edit,],
,Some digital signage with the ability to offer interactive media content will come with a usage reporting function. Each interaction users have made with the digital signage such as the photos that were taken, the number of games that were played will be recorded in the digital signage and produced in the form of a usage report. From the report, owners of the digital signage will be able to gauge the effectiveness of the particular advertisement or media content that was in play at the specific hour based on the number of times interaction has been made. Furthermore, if the digital signage is integrated with ,kinect,, the signage will be able to determine the proximity of the consumer to the display and their demographic details such as age, gender for further analytic and consumer behavior study.,[29],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Digital content is managed via display control software. This control software can be a stand-alone dedicated program or integrated with hardware. New messages can be created from an inventory of audio, video, image, graphics, words and phrases which are assembled in different combinations and permutations to yield new messages in real-time.
,
,Play media,  ,Video clip of a digital sign in ,Dearborn, MI,, USA,Digital content displayed on the signage is presented in one of the following formats:
,Text - Scrolling text. Either scrolling text, or text dynamically updated via external Newsfeed source.,
,Images - Scrolling images, usually in the format of digital advertisement posters,
,Video - many display control systems use canned graphics and video, however, custom video can be self-generated or contracted by many sources.,
,Interactive interfaces - Integration of signage with a touch screen, beacons, sensors, RFID technologies, to allow for two-way communications with the users. Interactive digital signage helps to engage users and may also assist advertisers to gain insight into customer behavior.,
,Context-aware interfaces,[30], - Integration of signage with cameras, sensors and software to monitor the ambient environment and audience, allowing signage to be updated according to the audience profile, weather conditions or some other relevant external factor.,
,Predecessors to electronic signage,[,edit,],
,  ,Digital signage as a ,flight information display system, at ,Geneva Airport, in ,Switzerland,Prior to the advent of digital signage throughout the industries, ,electronic paper, were used as display devices. Electronic paper were used to hold static texts and images indefinitely without electricity. The disadvantage to electronic paper as a form of digital signage is the limited reach of information transmission. Users that need to update the information will need to be in the same retail store, or be within the proximity for shopping malls. This required manual work from store staffs and shopping mall staff in maintaining the device with the latest information.
,First generation: Dot matrix display,[,edit,],
,First generation of digital signage display utilize ,LED, board, projection screens or other emerging display types like interactive surfaces or organic LED screens (,OLED,). A dot matrix display digital signage will relay the information within a database. All the information must be inputted manually by a person before the message display is updated. This form of digital signage is most commonly used in both train stations, airports, and other areas where information must be conveyed to the mass public. The downside of having dot matrix digital signage is the lack of media player. This digital signage will not be able to play multimedia contents.
,
,Second generation: Multimedia player digital signage,[,edit,],
,The second generation of digital signage is able to play multimedia contents and is controlled by a centralized management system. Digital audiovisual (av) content is reproduced on TVs and monitor displays of a digital sign network from at least one media player (usually a small computer unit, but ,DVD players, and other types of media sources may also be used). Various hardware and software options exist. These range from ,portable media players, that can output ,JPG, slide shows or loops of ,MPEG-2, video to networks consisting of multiple players and servers that offer control over enterprise-wide or campus-wide displays at many venues from a single location. The former are ideal for small groups of displays that can be updated via ,USB flash drive,, ,SD card, or ,CD-ROM,. Another option is the use of D.A.N. (Digital Advertising Network) players that connect directly to the monitor and to the internet, to a ,WAN, (Wide Area Network), or to a ,LAN, (Local Area Network). This allows the ,end user, the ability to manage multiple D.A.N. players from any location. The end user can create new advertising or edit existing advertisements and then upload changes to the D.A.N. via the internet or other networking options.
,APIs, for some digital sign software allow customized content management interfaces through which end-users can manage their content from one location.
,More advanced digital sign software allows content to be automatically created by the media players (computers) and servers on a minute-by-minute basis, combining real-time data, from news to weather, prices, transport schedules, etc., with av content to produce the most up-to-date content.,[31],
,
,Third generation: Interactive digital signage,[,edit,],
,The current generation of digital signage builds onto the previous generation with the added function to interact with the system. Users will be able to interact with the advertisement, scroll through the product menu, or share their information online via the new generation of digital signage. The interactive digital signage opens up interaction and ability to collect more personalize information. Some common uses of interactive digital signage are for users to take a picture and then connect to their ,Facebook,, ,Twitter,, ,Instagram,, or other ,Social media, platform to share the photo they have taken.

,Biography,[,edit,],
,Early life,[,edit,],
,Pepper Adams was born in ,Highland Park, Michigan,, to father Park Adams II and mother Cleo Marie Coyle.,[1],[4], Both of his parents were college graduates, with each spending some time at ,the University of Michigan,.,[5], Due to the onset of the ,Great Depression,, Adams' parents separated to allow his father to find work without geographic dependence.,[4], In the fall of 1931 Adams moved with his mother to his extended family's farm near ,Columbia City, Indiana,, where food and support were more readily available.,[4], In 1933 Adams began playing piano.,[4], His father having reunited with the family, they moved to ,Rochester, New York,, in 1935 and in that city he began his musical efforts on tenor sax and clarinet.,[4],  Two years later Adams began deepening his developing passion for music by listening to ,Fats Waller,'s daily radio show.,[4], He was also influenced at a young age by listening to ,Fletcher Henderson,'s big band radio broadcasts out of Nashville, ,Jimmie Lunceford,, ,Duke Ellington,, and ,Cab Calloway,.,[4],[6], Adams would later describe ""[his] time up until the age of eight or so [as] really just traveling from one place to another"".,[5], As early as 4th grade, Adams sold cigarettes and candy door-to-door in order to contribute to his family's income for essential items.,[4],
,Adams' interest in performing further grew in 6th grade when the public school system offered a loaned musical instrument to any student who was interested, and further musical instruction if he could get into the school band.,[4], Initially Adams chose the trumpet, then the trombone, but eventually settled on the ,clarinet,, which he played in the school band.,[4], The following year Adams attained his lifelong nickname of ""Pepper"" due to former ,St. Louis Cardinals, star ,Pepper Martin, signing on to manage and play for the hometown minor league team, the ,Rochester Red Wings,. Adams' classmates saw a resemblance between the two, and the nickname stuck.,[4], Later in his career, Adams also attained the nickname ""the Knife"" for ""his 'slashing and chopping technique', which had a humbling effect upon musicians fortunate enough to gig with him"".,[6],
,In 1943 Adams skipped school for a week in order to see Ellington play local gigs. He eventually met ,Rex Stewart,, who further introduced him to ,Harry Carney, and other band members. This led to Adams being able to take lessons from ,Skippy Williams,, who was the tenor saxophonist in Ellington's band.,[4], Adams switched to the tenor saxophone in the fall of 1943 due to his jobs as a box cutter in the mail order room of a jazz store and an usher at a movie theater, which gave him enough money to buy the instrument.,[4], His job at the jazz store also allowed him to listen to all of the newest available jazz records ,[5], and led to his emulation of ,Coleman Hawkins,, who he had heard play locally in 1945,,[7], and interest in the music of ,Don Byas,.,[4], Adams' first steady gig came in 1946 with a six-piece group led by ,Ben Smith,, which then caused him to drop out of school in the 11th grade due to working six nights a week.,[4],
,
,Early playing career,[,edit,],
,At age 16, Adams and his mother moved to Detroit, where he soon began playing with ,Willie Wells,, who he had heard play for ,Fletcher Henderson,, ,Fats Navarro,, ,Tommy Flanagan,, and Willie Anderson.,[4], He had received casual instruction from ,Wardell Gray, and ,Billy Mitchell,, and played with a group led by ,Little John Wilson, as well.,[7], Through the employee discount from his job at Grinnell's, a music store in Detroit, Adams purchased what would become his main instrument: the baritone saxophone.,[4], He initially purchased a used Bundy baritone saxophone, but later traded it in for a new ,Selmer, 'Balanced Action' E-flat baritone in 1948, which he used until 1978.,[4], This switch proved to be successful, as he was soon playing in ,Lucky Thompson,'s band.,[8], In Detroit, Adams also met several jazz musicians who would become future partners, including trumpeter ,Donald Byrd,. He attended ,Wayne State University,.,[9], Adams became interested in Wardell Gray's approach to the saxophone, later naming Gray and Harry Carney as his influences. He also spent time in a United States Army band, and briefly had a tour of duty in Korea.,[10],
,Upon returning from Korea, Adams began playing at the ,Blue Bird Inn, in Detroit where he played with ,Thad Jones, under the leadership of ,Beans Richardson,.,[4], When Jones left to play with ,Count Basie,, Adams then became the music director at the Blue Bird.,[4], In late 1954 Adams left the Blue Bird to join ,Kenny Burrell,'s group at Klein's Show Bar, also in Detroit, where he would later become musical director following Burrell's departure.,[4], Following the recommendation of friend ,Oscar Pettiford,, Adams joined the ,Stan Kenton Orchestra, in 1956, where he played for a majority of the year until leaving the group to form a new ensemble with ,Lee Katzman, and ,Mel Lewis, in Los Angeles.,[4], Before moving to California, Adams also recorded with ,Kenny Clarke,, ,Curtis Fuller,, and ,Quincy Jones,.,[6], In April 1957 Adams joined ,Chet Baker,'s group, where he played for about a year.,[4],
,He later moved to New York City, where he played on the album ,Dakar, with ,John Coltrane,, played with ,Lee Morgan, on ,The Cooker,, and briefly worked with ,Benny Goodman,'s band in 1958. During this time, Adams also began working with ,Charles Mingus,, performing on one of Mingus's ,Atlantic, albums of the period, ,Blues & Roots,, which includes Adams' extended solo on ""Moanin'"". Thereafter, he recorded with Mingus sporadically until the latter's death in 1979. Adams formed a quintet with ,Donald Byrd, in 1958 that lasted until 1961.,[4],  Following the breakup of the Donald Byrd–Pepper Adams Quintet, Adams lacked a consistent band association until 1965 and the formation of the Thad Jones–Pepper Adams Quintet.,[4], During this phase, he performed with the likes of ,Teddy Charles,, ,Pony Poindexter,, ,Marcus Belgrave,, ,Thelonious Monk,, and ,Lionel Hampton,.,[4], In September 1963, Adams made an agreement with ,Motown Records, for an exclusive recording contract and an exclusive management contract with International Talent Management, a Motown affiliate.,[4], Prior to signing with Motown, Adams turned down an offer from ,Harry James, to play in his Las Vegas-based band because it was extremely commercial and presented few opportunities to solo, despite its $10,000 annual salary.,[4],
,
,Partnership with Thad Jones,[,edit,],
,He later became a founding member,[8], of the ,Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band,, with whom he played from 1965 to 1976, and thereafter continued to record Jones's compositions on many of his own albums.,[11], Adams also co-led a quintet with Donald Byrd from 1958 to 1962, with whom he recorded a live date, ,10 to 4 at the 5 Spot, (,Riverside,), featuring ,Elvin Jones,,,[12], and a sequence of albums for ,Blue Note,. During this time he also played with the ,Sal Salvador Big Band, at the Diamond Beach Club in ,Wildwood, New Jersey,, in August 1965, along with ,Teddy Charles, in early 1966, and ,Ella Fitzgerald, in 1967.,[4], Most of the ,Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band, performances took place at the ,Village Vanguard, in New York City, along with many colleges and other locations around the United States, Europe, and Asia.,[4], The 18-year period spent with ,Thad Jones, was filled with almost constant touring when the band was not playing their steady gig at the ,Village Vanguard,.,[4], One of the ensemble's most frequent performing locations outside the United States was the ,Montmartre, in Copenhagen, Denmark.,[4],
,
,Solo career,[,edit,],
,Adams' solo career began in 1977 in California, where he initially stayed with John and Ron Marabuto.,[4], He soon played gigs with Mingus, Baker, and Hampton, with whom he went on a two-month European tour in 1978.,[4], On March 18, 1978 Adams purchased a new Selmer baritone saxophone that served as his interim back-up instrument for his original saxophone that he had been using since 1948.,[4], In 1979 Adams played several gigs with ,Per Husby, across Norway. On June 5, 1980, the Berg Larsen mouthpiece Adams had been using for 32 years finally broke, which led him to replace it with a Dukoff D-5 mouthpiece and a Bari plastic reed.,[4], The following day Adams premiered his new set-up at One Step Down in Washington, D.C.,[4],
,Adams began composing ""Urban Dreams"" on July 29, 1980, on a flight to London for a short European tour.,[4], Adams finally replaced his original ,Selmer, B-flat 'Balanced Action' baritone saxophone in December 1980 after 31 years of use.,[4], In 1981 Adams performed with Rein de Graaff's trio, the ,Per Husby Trio,, and the ,Franco D'Andrea Trio, for three short European tours.,[4], When in New York City, Adams performed at ,Fat Tuesday's, several times during this period of his career, one of which, ,Live at Fat Tuesday's,, earned him a Grammy nomination in 1984 for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance as a Soloist.,[4], In later years, Adams toured England and continental Europe several times, performing there with local rhythm sections, and he performed with a Count Basie tribute band at the Grande Parade du Jazz in Nice.,[8],
,
,Leg injury and end of career,[,edit,],
,Adams' life was severely altered by the leg injury he sustained in December 1983, which was caused by his car's parking brake becoming disengaged on his slanted driveway.,[4], This led the car to pin Adams up against his garage door, crushing his leg and restricting him to bed rest for the following five months.,[4], Despite the long recovery from his injury, Adams began playing again and exhibited his love for performing in October 1984 by flying from New York City all the way to Singapore for a one-night gig, then returning two days later.,[4], He eventually regained the strength in his leg to move without the use of a wheelchair or cane in January 1985, after more than a year of recovery.,[4],
,While in Sweden in March 1985, Adams visited a chest specialist at the suggestion of a friend, ,Gunnar Windahl,, and was diagnosed with ,lung cancer,.,[4], He was hospitalized for testing later that month in New York, then was forced to take a break from performing or traveling for two months that summer in order to undergo ,radiation treatments,.,[4], A benefit concert was held for Adams on September 29, 1985, in New York City that featured ,Dizzy Gillespie,, ,Frank Foster,, ,Kenny Burrell,, ,Tommy Flanagan,, and the ,Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra,, among others.,[4], Despite his various health issues, Adams continued pushing himself professionally, which was exemplified by his stretch in Dublin, Ireland, April 4–6, 1986, when he played five gigs over three days with five different bands.,[4],
,Adams was diagnosed with ,pleurisy, in April 1986 and died of lung cancer in ,Brooklyn, New York,, on September 10, 1986.,[13], His final performance took place on July 2, 1986, at the ,Spectrum, in Montreal as part of the ,Montreal Jazz Festival,.,[4], Before counting off the first song, he received a strong standing ovation from the crowd.,[4],
,
,Style,[,edit,],
,Pepper Adams was in many ways the antithesis of contemporary baritone players ,Gerry Mulligan, and ,Serge Chaloff,, who favored melodic ,cool jazz,.  In contrast, Adams managed to bring the cumbersome baritone into the blisteringly fast speeds of ,hard bop,.,[14],  Gary Carner,  Adams's biographer, described his style as having ""very long, tumbling, double-time melodic lines.  And that raw, piercing, bark-like timbre."",[8], Adams ""succeeded in elevating [the baritone saxophone] to the level of all other solo instruments [with] blinding speed, penetrating timbre, distinctive sound, harmonic ingenuity, precise articulation, confident time-feel, and use of melodic paraphrase"".,[15], Throughout his career, Adams consistently chose musical expression over large paychecks, as ""[he] repeatedly recalled with great satisfaction his decision to play [in groups focused on musical expression] rather than to change his style to secure better paying jobs with now little-known white musicians"".,[7], A large part of Adams' appeal was that ""[he] had the remarkable ability to blow low with enormous power and swing, becoming a hefty addition to big band reed sections. He also was an equally dominant voice in small groups, adding ferocious excitement and stamina"".,[16],
,Despite his prowess at hard bop, Adams was also adept at ballads and slower numbers. An example is his contribution to the album ,Chet, (1958) including a solo on the bittersweet "",Alone Together,"" that critic Dave Nathan described as ""one of the album's high points"".,[17],
,
,Awards and honors,[,edit,],
,He won ,Down Beat,',s New Star award in 1957 and was named baritone soloist of the year for 1980.,[13], Adams was nominated three times for a ,Grammy Award,, including nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance as a Soloist for ,Reflectory, in 1979 and Best Jazz Soloist for ,The Master,.,[4], In the 1975  ,Playboy, magazine annual music poll, he was named an All Star's All-Star. In 1967 Adams received the Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition award from ,Down Beat,.,[4], From 1979 to 1982 Adams won the award for best baritone saxophonist from ,Down Beat,',s International Jazz Critics' Poll on four consecutive occasions,,[4], something Adams attributed to his frequent touring of Europe throughout his career.,[5], In December 1982 Adams won the ,Down Beat, Readers' Poll award for the best baritone saxophonist in the world, unseating Gerry Mulligan, who had held that distinction since 1953.,[4],

,Biography,[,edit,],
,Early life,[,edit,],
,Coleman was born on the 9th of March, 1930, in ,Fort Worth, Texas,,,[3], where he was raised.,[4],[5],[6],
,He attended ,I.M. Terrell High School,, where he participated in band until he was dismissed for improvising during "",The Washington Post,"" march. He began performing ,R&B, and ,bebop, on tenor saxophone and started The Jam Jivers with ,Prince Lasha, and ,Charles Moffett,.,[6],
,Eager to leave town, he accepted a job in 1949 with a ,Silas Green from New Orleans, traveling show and then with touring rhythm and blues shows. After a show in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he was assaulted and his saxophone was destroyed.,[7],
,He switched to alto saxophone, which remained his primary instrument, first playing it in New Orleans after the Baton Rouge incident. He then joined the band of ,Pee Wee Crayton, and traveled with them to Los Angeles. He worked at various jobs, including as an elevator operator, while pursuing his music career.
,In California he found like-minded musicians such as ,Ed Blackwell,, ,Bobby Bradford,, ,Don Cherry,, ,Charlie Haden,, ,Billy Higgins,, and ,Charles Moffett,.,[8],[9], He recorded his debut album, ,Something Else!!!!, (1958) with Cherry, Higgins, ,Walter Norris,, and ,Don Payne,.,[10], During the same year he belonged briefly to a quintet led by ,Paul Bley, that performed at a club in New York City.,[8], By the time ,Tomorrow Is the Question!, was recorded soon after with Cherry, Higgins, and Haden, the jazz world had been shaken up by Coleman's alien music. Some jazz musicians called him a fraud, while conductor ,Leonard Bernstein, praised him.,[9],
,
,1959: ,The Shape of Jazz to Come,[,edit,],
,In 1959 ,Atlantic, released ,The Shape of Jazz to Come,. According to music critic Steve Huey, the album ""was a watershed event in the genesis of avant-garde jazz, profoundly steering its future course and throwing down a gauntlet that some still haven't come to grips with."",[11], ,Jazzwise, listed it No. 3 on their list of the 100 best jazz albums of all time.,[12],
,Coleman's quartet received a long – and sometimes controversial – engagement at ,Five Spot, jazz club in New York City. ,Leonard Bernstein,, ,Lionel Hampton,, and ,Modern Jazz Quartet, were impressed and offered encouragement. Hampton asked to perform with the quartet; Bernstein helped Haden obtain a composition grant from the ,John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation,. But trumpeter ,Miles Davis, said Coleman was ""all screwed up inside"",,[13],[14], although he recanted this comment and became a proponent of Coleman's innovations.,[15],
,Coleman's early sound was due in part to his use of a ,plastic saxophone,. He bought a plastic horn in Los Angeles in 1954 because he was unable to afford a metal saxophone, though he didn't like the sound of the plastic instrument at first.,[6],
,On the Atlantic recordings, Coleman's sidemen in the quartet are Cherry on cornet or ,pocket trumpet,; Charlie Haden, ,Scott LaFaro,, and then ,Jimmy Garrison, on bass; and Higgins or his replacement ,Ed Blackwell, on drums. The complete recordings for the label were collected on the box set ,Beauty Is a Rare Thing,.,[8],
,
,1960: ,Free Jazz,[,edit,],
,In 1960, Coleman recorded ,Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation,, which featured a double quartet, including Don Cherry and ,Freddie Hubbard, on trumpet, ,Eric Dolphy, on bass clarinet, Haden and LaFaro on bass, and both Higgins and Blackwell on drums.,[16], The album was recorded in stereo with a reed/brass/bass/drums quartet isolated in each stereo channel. ,Free Jazz, was, at nearly 40 minutes, the longest recorded continuous jazz performance to date,[17], and was one of Coleman's most controversial albums. The music features a regular but complex pulse, one drummer playing ""straight"" while the other played double-time; the thematic material is a series of brief, dissonant fanfares. A series of solo features for each member of the band, but the other soloists are free to chime in as they wish.,[18], In the January 18, 1962 issue of ,Down Beat, magazine, in a review titled ""Double View of a Double Quartet,"" Pete Welding gave the album five stars while John A. Tynan rated it zero stars.,[19], Time has been kinder to the album, though, with ,AllMusic, listing it as one of ""20 Essential Free Jazz albums."",[16],
,Coleman intended ""free jazz"" as simply an album title. But his growing reputation placed him at the forefront of jazz innovation, and ,free jazz, was soon considered a new genre, though Coleman has expressed discomfort with the term. Among the reasons he may have disapproved of the term is that his music contains ,composition,. His melodic material, although skeletal, recalls melodies that ,Charlie Parker, wrote over ,standard, harmonies. The music is closer to the bebop that came before it than is sometimes popularly imagined.,[20],
,
,1960s–70s: Avant-garde and harmolodic funk,[,edit,],
,  ,Coleman in 1971,
,After the Atlantic period and into the early part of the 1970s, Coleman's music became more angular and engaged with the ,avant-garde jazz, which had developed in part around his innovations.,[8],
,After his quartet disbanded, he formed a trio with ,David Izenzon, on bass and ,Charles Moffett, on drums. He extended the sound of his music, introducing string players and playing trumpet and violin, which he played left-handed. He had little conventional musical technique and used the instruments to make large, unrestrained gestures. His friendship with ,Albert Ayler, influenced his development on trumpet and violin. Charlie Haden sometimes joined this trio to form a two-bass quartet.
,Coleman signed with ,Blue Note, and recorded ,At the Golden Circle Stockholm,.,[21], In 1966, he recorded ,The Empty Foxhole, with his son, ,Denardo Coleman,, who was ten years old. ,Freddie Hubbard, and ,Shelly Manne, regarded this as an ill-advised piece of publicity on Coleman's part.,[22],[23], Despite his youth, Denardo Coleman had studied drumming for several years. His technique was unrefined but enthusiastic, owing more to pulse-oriented free jazz drummers like ,Sunny Murray, than to bebop drummers.,[21], He became his father's primary drummer in the late 1970s.
,Coleman formed another quartet. Haden, Garrison, and ,Elvin Jones, appeared, and ,Dewey Redman, joined the group, usually on tenor saxophone. On February 29, 1968 in a group with Haden, ,Ed Blackwell,, and ,David Izenzon, Coleman performed live with ,Yoko Ono, at ,Albert Hall,. One song was included on the album ,Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, (1970),[24],
,He continued to explore his interest in string textures – from ,Town Hall, 1962,, culminating with the ,Skies of America, album in 1972. (Sometimes this had a practical value, as it facilitated his group's appearance in the UK in 1965, where jazz musicians were under a quota arrangement but classical performers were exempt.)
,Coleman, like Miles Davis before him, took to playing with ,electrified instruments,. The 1976 funk album ,Dancing in Your Head,, Coleman's first recording with the group which later became known as ,Prime Time,, prominently featured electric guitars. While this marked a stylistic departure for Coleman, the music maintained certain similarities to his earlier work. These performances had the same angular melodies and simultaneous group improvisations – what ,Joe Zawinul, referred to as ""nobody solos, everybody solos"" and what Coleman called ,harmolodics, – and although the nature of the pulse was altered, Coleman's rhythmic approach was not.

,1980s–90s,[,edit,],

,  ,Ornette Coleman at Great American Music Hall, San Francisco  10/29/81,
,In the 1980s, albums like ,Virgin Beauty, and ,Of Human Feelings, continued to use ,rock, and ,funk, rhythms, sometimes called ,free funk,.,[25],[26], ,Jerry Garcia, played guitar on three tracks from Coleman's 1988 album ,Virgin Beauty,: ""Three Wishes"", ""Singing in the Shower"", and ""Desert Players"". Coleman joined the ,Grateful Dead, on stage in 1993 during ""Space"" and stayed for ""The Other One"", ""Stella Blue"", ,Bobby Bland,'s ""Turn on Your Lovelight"", and the encore ""Brokedown Palace"".,[27],[28], Another collaboration was with guitarist ,Pat Metheny,, with whom Coleman recorded ,Song X, (1985); though released under Metheny's name, Coleman was essentially co-leader (contributing all the compositions).
,In 1990, the city of ,Reggio Emilia, in Italy held a three-day ""Portrait of the Artist"" featuring a Coleman quartet with Cherry, Haden, and Higgins. The festival also presented performances of his chamber music and the symphonic ,Skies of America,. In 1991, Coleman played on the soundtrack for ,David Cronenberg,'s ,Naked Lunch,; the orchestra was conducted by ,Howard Shore,. It is notable among other things for including a rare sighting of Coleman playing a jazz standard: Thelonious Monk's ""Misterioso"". Two 1972 (pre-electric) Coleman recordings, ""Happy House"" and ""Foreigner in a Free Land"", were used in ,Gus Van Sant,'s 2000 ,Finding Forrester,. He released four records in 1995 and 1996, and for the first time in many years worked regularly with piano players (either ,Geri Allen, or ,Joachim Kühn,).
,
,2000s,[,edit,],
,  ,Coleman at the Enjoy Jazz Festival, ,Heidelberg,, October 2008,
,In September 2006 he released a live album titled ,Sound Grammar, with his son, Denardo Coleman, and two bassists, ,Greg Cohen,, and Tony Falanga. This was his first album of new material in ten years and was recorded in Germany in 2005. It won the 2007 ,Pulitzer Prize, for music, Coleman being only the second jazz musician to win the prize.,[29],
,Jazz pianist ,Joanne Brackeen, stated in an interview with ,Marian McPartland, that Coleman mentored her and gave her music lessons.,[30],
,

,Biography,[,edit,],
,Brown was born into a musical family in a progressive East-Side neighborhood of ,Wilmington, Delaware,. His father organized his four youngest sons, including Clifford, into a vocal quartet. Around age ten, Brown started playing trumpet at school after becoming fascinated with the shiny trumpet his father owned. At age thirteen, upon entering senior high, his father bought him his own trumpet and provided him with private lessons. As a junior in high school, he received lessons from Robert Boysie Lowery and played in ""a jazz group that Lowery organized."" He even began making trips to Philadelphia. Brown took pride in his neighborhood and earned a good education from Howard High.,[6],
,Brown briefly attended ,Delaware State University,[7], as a math major, before he switched to ,Maryland State College,, which was a more prosperous musical environment. As Nick Catalano points out, Brown's trips to Philadelphia grew in frequency after he graduated from high school and entered Delaware State University; it could be said that, although his dorm was in ,Dover,, his classroom was in Philadelphia. Brown played in the fourteen-piece, jazz-oriented, Maryland State Band. In June 1950, he was seriously injured in a car accident after a successful gig. During his year-long hospitalization, ,Dizzy Gillespie, visited the younger trumpeter and pushed him to pursue his musical career.,[8], Brown's injuries limited him to the piano for months; he never fully recovered and would routinely dislocate his shoulder for the rest of his life.,[6], Brown moved into playing music professionally, where he quickly became one of the most highly regarded trumpeters in jazz.,[2],
,Brown was influenced and encouraged by ,Fats Navarro,,,[8], whom he first met at the age of 15, sharing Navarro's virtuosic technique and brilliance of invention. His sound was warm and round, and notably consistent across the full range of the instrument. He could articulate every note, even at very fast tempos which seemed to present no difficulty to him; this served to enhance the impression of his speed of execution. His sense of harmony was highly developed, enabling him to deliver bold statements through complex harmonic progressions (,chord, changes), and embodying the linear, ""algebraic"" terms of ,bebop, harmony. In addition to his up-tempo prowess, he could express himself deeply in a ballad performance.
,His first recordings were with ,R&B, bandleader ,Chris Powell,,,[8], following which he performed with ,Tadd Dameron,, ,J. J. Johnson,, ,Lionel Hampton,, and ,Art Blakey, before forming his own group with ,Max Roach,. The Clifford Brown & Max Roach Quintet was a high-water mark of the ,hard bop, style, with all the members of the group except for bassist ,George Morrow, contributing original songs. Brown's trumpet was originally partnered with ,Harold Land,'s tenor saxophone. After Land left in 1955 in order to spend more time with his wife, ,Sonny Rollins, joined and remained a member of the group for the rest of its existence. In their hands, the bebop vernacular reached a peak of inventiveness.,[2],
,The clean-living Brown escaped the influence of ,heroin, and alcohol on the jazz world. Brown stayed away from drugs and was not fond of alcohol.,[2], Rollins, who was recovering from heroin addiction, said that ""Clifford was a profound influence on my personal life. He showed me that it was possible to live a good, clean life and still be a good jazz musician."",[9],
,In June 1956, Brown and ,Richie Powell, embarked on a drive to ,Chicago, for their next appearance. Powell's wife Nancy was at the wheel so that Clifford and Richie could sleep. While driving at night in the rain on the ,Pennsylvania Turnpike,, west of ,Bedford,, she is presumed to have lost control of the car, which went off the road, killing all three in the resulting crash.,[10], Brown is buried in Mt. Zion Cemetery, in Wilmington, Delaware.,[11],
,
,Family,[,edit,],
,On June 26, 1954, in ,Los Angeles,, Brown married Emma LaRue Anderson (1933–2005), who he called "",Joy Spring,"". The two had been introduced by ,Max Roach,.  They actually celebrated their marriage vows three times, partly because their families were on opposite coasts and partly because of their differing religions – Brown was Methodist and Anderson was Catholic. They were first married in a private ceremony June 26, 1954, in ,Los Angeles, (on Anderson's 21st birthday).  They again celebrated their marriage in a religious setting on July 16, 1954 – the certificate being registered in Los Angeles County – and a reception was held at the ,Tiffany Club, where the ,Art Pepper,/,Jack Montrose, Quintet had been replaced a few days earlier by the ,Red Norvo, Trio with ,Tal Farlow, and ,Red Mitchell,. Then, Anderson's parish priest followed them to ,Boston,, where, on August 1, 1954, they performed their marriage ceremony at Saint Richards Church in the ,Roxbury, neighborhood.,[12],  They had a son, Clifford Benjamin Brown, Jr. (born 1955).
,
,Legacy,[,edit,],
,His nephew, drummer ,Rayford Griffin, ,(né, Rayford Galen Griffin; born 1958), modernized Brown's music on his 2015 album ,Reflections of Brownie.,[13], Brown's grandson, Clifford Benjamin Brown III (born 1982), plays trumpet on one of the tracks, ""Sandu"".
,Benny Golson,, who had done a stint in Lionel Hampton's band with Brown, and was a member along with Brown of Tadd Dameron's Big 10, wrote "",I Remember Clifford,"" to honor his memory. The piece became a ,jazz standard,, as musicians paid tribute by recording their own interpretations of it.
,Duke Pearson, who had yet to record for Blue Note records wrote ""Tribute To Brownie"", which was recorded by the ,Cannonball Adderley, Quintet on his 1957 album, ,Sophisticated Swing,. It also appeared on an album by trumpeter ,Louis Smith,, ,Here Comes Louis Smith, with Cannonball again on alto saxophone.
,Helen Merrill,, who recorded with Brown in 1954 (,Helen Merrill,, EmArcy), recorded a tribute album in 1995 entitled ,Brownie: Homage to Clifford Brown,. The album features solos and ensemble work by trumpeters ,Lew Soloff,, ,Tom Harrell,, ,Wallace Roney,, and ,Roy Hargrove,.
,Arturo Sandoval,'s entire second album after fleeing from his native Cuba, entitled ,I Remember Clifford,, was likewise a tribute to Brown.
,Each year, Wilmington hosts the ,Clifford Brown Jazz Festival,.
,Brownie Speaks,, a video documentary, is the culmination of years of research by Wilmington-born jazz pianist Don Glanden, research that has included interviews with Brown's friends, family, contemporaries, and admirers. Glanden's son Brad edited these interviews, along with archival materials and newly shot video footage. The documentary premiered in 2008 at the ""Brownie Speaks"" Clifford Brown Symposium hosted by the ,University of the Arts, in Philadelphia. The three-day symposium featured performances from close friends and bandmates of Brown such as Golson and ,Lou Donaldson, and other artists inspired by Brown, including ,Marcus Belgrave,, ,Terence Blanchard,, and ,John Fedchock,.
,Spanish film director ,Jesús Franco, often used Clifford Brown as a screen pseudonym in homage to one of his musical heroes.
,In 1994, Brown's widow, LaRue Brown Watson, established the Clifford Brown Jazz Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Brown's memory and inspiring a love for jazz among young people. The Foundation is under the direction of Clifford Brown III, Brown's grandson and a respected Bay Area trumpeter and music producer.
,In 2014 a campaign was launched to restore Brown's grave site at Mt. Zion Cemetery on ,Lancaster Pike,, just outside the city limits in Wilmington, Delaware.,[11],

,Miles Dewey Davis III, (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz ,trumpeter,, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the ,history of jazz, and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.,[1],
,Born in ,Alton, Illinois,, and raised in ,East St. Louis,, Davis left to study at the ,Juilliard School, in ,New York City,, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of ,saxophonist, ,Charlie Parker,'s ,bebop, quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ,Birth of the Cool, sessions for ,Capitol Records,, which were instrumental to the development of ,cool jazz,. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest ,hard bop, music while on ,Prestige Records, but did so haphazardly due to a ,heroin, addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the ,Newport Jazz Festival, in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with ,Columbia Records, and recorded the 1957 album ,'Round About Midnight,.,[2], It was his first work with saxophonist ,John Coltrane, and bassist ,Paul Chambers,, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger ,Gil Evans,, such as the Spanish-influenced ,Sketches of Spain, (1960), and band recordings, such as ,Milestones, (1958) and ,Kind of Blue, (1959).,[3], The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,,[4], having sold over five million copies in the U.S.
,Davis made several lineup changes while recording ,Someday My Prince Will Come, (1961), his ,1961 Blackhawk concerts,, and ,Seven Steps to Heaven, (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist ,Ron Carter,, pianist ,Herbie Hancock,, and drummer ,Tony Williams,.,[3], After adding saxophonist ,Wayne Shorter, to his new quintet in 1964,,[3], Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the ,post-bop, genre with albums such as ,E.S.P, (1965) and ,Miles Smiles, (1967),,[5], before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he  experimented with rock, funk, ,African rhythms,, emerging ,electronic music technology,, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist ,Joe Zawinul,, drummer ,Al Foster,, and guitarist ,John McLaughlin,.,[6], This period, beginning with Davis' 1969 studio album ,In a Silent Way, and concluding with the 1975 concert recording ,Agharta,, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz.,[7], His million-selling 1970 record ,Bitches Brew, helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with ,jazz fusion, as the decade progressed.,[8],
,After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and ,pop, sounds on albums such as ,The Man with the Horn, (1981) and ,Tutu, (1986). Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a ,stroke,, ,pneumonia, and ,respiratory failure,.,[9], In 2006, Davis was inducted into the ,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,,,[10], which recognized him as ""one of the key figures in the history of jazz."",[10], ,Rolling Stone, described him as ""the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"",[9], while ,Gerald Early, called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.,[11],

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Miles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent ,African-American, family in ,Alton,, Illinois, 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of ,St. Louis,.,[12],[13], He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae (born 1925), and a younger brother, Vernon (born 1929). His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of ,Arkansas,, was a music teacher and violinist, and his father, ,Miles Dewey Davis Jr.,, also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a 200-acre (81 ha) estate near ,Pine Bluff,, Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses.,[14],[15], In 1927, the family moved to ,East St. Louis,, Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighborhood. From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school,,[13], then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports.,[15], At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.,[14],
,
,  ,The house at 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis lived from 1939 to 1944,
,In 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father.,[16], He took lessons from ,Elwood Buchanan,, a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father.,[12], His mother wanted him to play violin instead.,[17], Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without ,vibrato, and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles.,[17],[12],[18], In later years Davis said, ""I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can't get that sound I can't play anything."",[19], In 1939, the family moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis. On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet,,[16], and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the ,St. Louis Symphony Orchestra,.,[16],
,In 1941, the 15-year-old attended ,East St. Louis Lincoln High School,, where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that he was discriminated against in these competitions due to his race, but he added that these experiences made him a better musician.,[15], When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn't do it, he began to learn ,music theory,. ""I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory."",[20], At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon).,[21], He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.,[22], Part of his earnings paid for his sister's education at ,Fisk University,.,[23], Davis befriended trumpeter ,Clark Terry,, who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.,[16],[23],
,With encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the band's musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal.,[24],[23], Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career.,[20], ,Sonny Stitt, tried to persuade him to join the ,Tiny Bradshaw, band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, ""I didn't talk to her for two weeks. And I didn't go with the band either."",[25], In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.,[23],
,In July 1944, ,Billy Eckstine, visited St. Louis with a band that included ,Art Blakey,, ,Dizzy Gillespie,, and ,Charlie Parker,. Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform,,[12], so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera.,[23],[26], After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City ""where the action was."",[27], His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.,[25],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,1944–1948: New York City and the bebop years,[,edit,],
,  ,Tommy Potter,, ,Charlie Parker,, ,Max Roach,, Miles Davis, ,Duke Jordan, in August 1947,
,In September 1944, Davis accepted his father's idea of studying at the ,Institute of Musical Arts,, later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City.,[23], After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano, and dictation.,[28],
,But he spent much of his time in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker. According to Davis, Coleman Hawkins told him ""finish your studies at Juilliard and forget Bird."",[29],[26], After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at ,Minton's, and ,Monroe's, in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included ,J. J. Johnson,, ,Kenny Clarke,, ,Thelonious Monk,, ,Fats Navarro,, and ,Freddie Webster,. Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.,[26],[23],
,In mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the year's autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters,[14],[30],[23], because he wanted to perform full-time.,[31], Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and ""white"" repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.
,He began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and ,Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis,. He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945 when he entered the studio as a sideman for ,Herbie Fields,'s band.,[23],[26], During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.,[32],
,
,  ,Davis on piano with ,Howard McGhee, (trumpet), Joe Albany (pianist, standing) and ,Brick Fleagle, (guitarist, smoking), September 1947,
,In 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parker's quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parker's group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and ,Max Roach,,,[23], displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parker's tune "",Now's the Time,"", Davis played a solo that anticipated ,cool jazz,. He then joined a big band led by ,Benny Carter,, performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie.,[33], In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months.,[33],[34], In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist ,Charles Mingus, that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year.,[33], Davis noted that by this time, ""I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene."" He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.,[35],
,He was a member of Billy Eckstine's big band in 1946 and Gillespie's in 1947.,[36], He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with ,Duke Jordan, and ,Tommy Potter, for much of the year, including several studio sessions.,[33], In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune ""Cheryl"", named after his daughter. Davis's first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist ,John Lewis,, and bassist ,Nelson Boyd,; they recorded ""Milestones"", ""Half Nelson"", and ""Sippin' at Bells"".,[37],[33], After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parker's quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the ,Jazz at the Philharmonic, tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.,[33],
,
,1948–1950: Miles Davis Nonet and ,Birth of the Cool,[,edit,],
,In August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join ,Duke Ellington,'s orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger ,Gil Evans, and baritone saxophonist ,Gerry Mulligan,, taking an active role on what soon became his own project.,[38],[33], Evans' Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop.,[39], These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis ,Nonet,, which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba. The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for ,Count Basie, at the ,Royal Roost, for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venue's manager to write the sign ""Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan."" He prevailed only with the help of ,Monte Kay,, the club's artistic director. Davis returned to Parker's quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parker's erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction.,[33], Early in his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice.,[40], Davis and Roach objected to the addition of pianist ,Duke Jordan,, preferring ,Bud Powell,.,[41],
,In December 1948 Davis quit,,[33], claiming he was not being paid. His departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with ,Capitol Records,, they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the ""cool"" or ""west coast"" style of jazz.,[33], The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player ,Bill Barber,, alto saxophonist ,Lee Konitz,, who had been preferred to ,Sonny Stitt, as his style was considered too bop-oriented, pianist ,Al Haig,, trombone players ,Mike Zwerin, with ,Kai Winding,, French horn players ,Junior Collins, with Sandy Siegelstein and ,Gunther Schuller,, and bassists ,Al McKibbon, and ,Joe Shulman,. One track featured singer ,Kenny Hagood,. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms.,[42], Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol continued until April 1950; much of it remained unreleased until the issue of ,Birth of the Cool, (1957).
,In May 1949, Davis performed with the ,Tadd Dameron, Quintet with ,Kenny Clarke, and ,James Moody, at the ,Paris International Jazz Festival,. On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in America. The trip, he said, ""changed the way I looked at things forever."",[43], He began an affair with singer and actress ,Juliette Gréco,.,[44],
,
,1949–1955: Signing with Prestige, heroin addiction, and hard bop,[,edit,],
,After returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950.,[45], He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, ""lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift."",[46],[33], In August 1950, during a family trip to East St. Louis and Chicago in an attempt to improve their fortunes, Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer ,Johnny Bratton, and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer ,Betty Carter,. He remained grateful to her for the rest of his life.,[45], He toured with Eckstine and ,Billie Holiday, and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in ,DownBeat, magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.,[47],
,In January 1951, Davis's fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with ,Prestige, after owner ,Bob Weinstock, became a fan of the nonet ,[48], Davis chose Lewis, trombonist ,Bennie Green,, bassist ,Percy Heath,, saxophonist ,Sonny Rollins,, and drummer ,Roy Haynes,; they recorded what became part of ,Miles Davis and Horns, (1956). Davis was hired for other studio dates in March, June, and September 1951,[47], and started transcribing scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. During the next month, he recorded his second session for Prestige as band leader. The material was released on ,The New Sounds, (1951), ,Dig, (1956), and ,Conception, (1956).,[49],
,Davis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a ,Down Beat, interview with ,Cab Calloway,, whom he never forgave as it brought him ""all pain and suffering."",[50], He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.,[50], Though he continued to use heroin, he met Roach and Mingus in September 1953 on their way to Los Angeles and joined their band, but the trip caused problems.,[51], He returned to his father's home, ""determined to kick my habit ... that was the only thing on my mind."",[52], He locked himself inside the guest house ""for about seven or eight days"" until he had gone through withdrawal. After the ordeal, he ""sat down and started thinking about how I was going to get my life back together."",[53],
,Davis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with ,Elvin Jones, and ,Tommy Flanagan, as part of ,Billy Mitchell,'s house band at the ,Blue Bird, club. He was also ""pimping a little."",[54], A widely related story, attributed to Richard ""Prophet"" Jennings,,[55],[56], was that Davis stumbled into ,Baker's Keyboard Lounge, out of the rain, carrying his trumpet in a paper bag under his coat. He walked to the bandstand, interrupted Roach and ,Clifford Brown, in the middle of performing "",Sweet Georgia Brown,"", and played "",My Funny Valentine,"" before leaving. Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident. He disputed this account, stating that Roach had invited him to play and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident. He said he was inspired to quit by his idol, boxer ,Sugar Ray Robinson,.,[57],
,
,  ,During the 1950s, Davis started using a ,mute, on his trumpet. It became part of his signature sound for the rest of his career.,
,In February 1954 Davis returned to New York City, feeling good ""for the first time in a long time,"" mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym.,[58], He informed Weinstock and management at ,Blue Note, that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the resulting albums ,Miles Davis Quartet, (1954) and ,Miles Davis Volume 2, (1956) ""very important"" because he felt his performances were particularly strong.,[59], He was paid roughly $750 (US$7,140 in 2019 dollars,[60],) for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.,[61],
,Davis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist ,Ahmad Jamal,, whose approach and use of space influenced him.,[62], When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record ,Miles Davis Quartet,, he wanted a pianist like Jamal and picked ,Red Garland,.,[62], ,Blue Haze, (1956), ,Bags' Groove, (1957), ,Walkin', (1957), and ,Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, (1959) were recorded after his recovery from heroin addiction. They documented the evolution of his sound with the ,Harmon mute,, also known as a ,wah-wah, mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in ,hard bop,, which was slower than bebop, less radical in harmony and melody, and often used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.,[63], A few critics consider ,Walkin' , (April 1954) the album that created the hard bop genre.,[19],
,Davis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson ""was the most important thing in my life besides music"" and adopted Robinson's ""arrogant attitude."",[64], He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with ,Thelonious Monk, during the recording of ,Bags' Groove, was reported.,[65], In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gréco for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects. The two had been in occasional contact since he left Paris. Davis being too busy to move to Spain with her, they've agreed to get together the next time he comes to France.,[66],
,Davis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955.,[67], The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation—but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life.,[68], He was called the ""prince of darkness,"" adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.,[69],
,
,1955–1959: Signing with Columbia, first quintet, and modal jazz,[,edit,],
,In July 1955, Davis's fortunes improved considerably when he was invited to the second annual ,Newport Jazz Festival, on July 17, with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer ,Connie Kay,, and horn players ,Zoot Sims, and ,Gerry Mulligan,. He convinced organizer ,George Wein, that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed.,[70], The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences.,[71], He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 ,Down Beat, magazine Readers' Poll.,[72],
,George Avakian, of ,Columbia Records, saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US$38,176 in 2019 dollars,[60],) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.,[73],[74],
,At the request of Avakian, he formed the ,Miles Davis Quintet, for a performance at ,Café Bohemia,. The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, ,Red Garland, on piano, ,Paul Chambers, on double bass, and ,Philly Joe Jones, on drums. Rollins was replaced by ,John Coltrane,, completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige: ,Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, (1957), ,Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, (1958), ,Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, (1960), and ,Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, (1961). The music on all four albums was recorded in two one-day sessions in 1956 with ,Rudy Van Gelder,. Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.,[75],[76],[77],
,The style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the ,Great American Songbook, and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ,'Round About Midnight,, Davis's first album for Columbia.
,In 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the ,Modern Jazz Quartet, and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gréco and they ""remained lovers for many years"".,[66],[78], He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.,[79], At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and ,Art Taylor,.,[80],
,In November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the ,soundtrack, to ,Ascenseur pour l'échafaud,[36], directed by ,Louis Malle, (1958). Consisting of French session musicians ,Barney Wilen,, ,Pierre Michelot,, and ,René Urtreger,, and American drummer ,Kenny Clarke,, the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.
,After returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley,[36], and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ,Milestones, (1958), an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in ,modal jazz,. A performance by ,Les Ballets Africains, drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.,[81], In this form of ballet music, the ,kalimba, was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of ,consonance and dissonance,.,[82],
,By May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer ,Jimmy Cobb,, and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on ""Sid's Ahead"" for the album ,Milestones,.,[83], He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired ,Bill Evans,, a young, white pianist with a background in classical music.,[84], Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. ,Wynton Kelly,, his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ,Jazz Track, (1958).,[84],
,
,1957–1963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ,Kind of Blue,[,edit,],
,By early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring with his quintet and wished to pursue new projects. During a two-week residency in Chicago in March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire at its conclusion and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at ,Harvard University, and a musical director at a record label.,[85],[86], Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.,[86], Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to ,Music for Brass, (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by ,Gunther Schuller, featuring Davis as a guest soloist.
,Davis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.,[87], ,Miles Ahead, (1957) showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition ""The Maids of Cadiz"" by ,Léo Delibes,, the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.,[88],[89], ,Porgy and Bess, (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's ,opera,. ,Sketches of Spain, (1960) contained music by composers ,Joaquín Rodrigo, and ,Manuel de Falla, and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.,[90], Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.,[91], The pair's final album was ,Quiet Nights, (1962), a collection of ,bossa nova, songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer ,Teo Macero, and refused to speak to him for more than two years.,[92], Davis noted later that ""my best friend is Gil Evans"";,[93], their work was included in the boxed set ,Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings, (1996), which won a ,Grammy Award for Best Historical Album, and ,Best Album Notes, in 1997.
,In March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, ,Kind of Blue, (1959). He named the album for its mood.,[94], He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.,[95], Both Davis and Evans were familiar with ,George Russell,'s ideas about modal jazz.,[96],[97], But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, "",Freddie Freeloader,."" ,[95], The sextet had played "",So What,"" and "",All Blues,"" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.
,Released in August 1959, ,Kind of Blue, was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.,[94], It remains the best selling jazz album of all time. In October 2008, the album reached ,4× platinum, certification from the ,Recording Industry Association of America, for selling over four million copies in the US alone.,[98], In 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution that honored it as a national treasure.,[99],[100],
,During the success of ,Kind of Blue,, Davis found himself involved with the law. On August 25, 1959, during a recording session at the ,Birdland, nightclub in New York City for the US Armed Services, he took a break outside the club. As he was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi, policeman Gerald Kilduff told him to ""move on."",[101],[102], Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move.,[103], Kilduff arrested him and grabbed him as he tried to protect himself.,[102], Witnesses said the policeman punched Davis in the stomach with a nightstick without provocation.,[102], Two detectives held the crowd back, while a third approached Davis from behind and beat him in the head. Davis was taken to jail, charged for assaulting an officer, then taken to the hospital where he received five stitches.,[102], He was released on a $525 bail (US$4,605 in 2019 dollars,[60],).,[101], By January 1960, he was acquitted of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault.,[82], He later stated the incident ""changed my whole life and whole attitude again, made me feel bitter and cynical again when I was starting to feel good about the things that had changed in this country."",[82],
,Davis and his sextet toured to support ,Kind of Blue,.,[94], He persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his quartet, though he returned for some tracks on Davis's album ,Someday My Prince Will Come, (1961). Its front cover shows a photograph of his wife, ,Frances Taylor,, after Davis demanded that Columbia depict black women on his album covers.,[104], In 1957,,[105], Davis began a relationship with Frances Taylor, a dancer he had met in 1953 at ,Ciro's, in Los Angeles.,[106],[107], They married on December 21, 1959 in ,Toledo, Ohio,.,[108], The relationship involved numerous incidents of Davis' ,domestic violence, towards Taylor. He later wrote, ""Every time I hit her, I felt bad because a lot of it really wasn't her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous."",[109],[110],[111], One reason for his behavior was that in 1963 he had increased his use of alcohol and cocaine to reduce joint pain caused by ,sickle cell anemia,.,[112],[91], He hallucinated, ""looking for this imaginary person"" in his house while wielding a kitchen knife. Soon after the photograph for the album ,E.S.P., (1965) was taken, Taylor left him for the final time.,[113], She filed for divorce in 1966; it was finalized in February 1968.,[114],[115], Davis later recalled that ""Frances was the best wife I ever had and I made a mistake when I broke up with her."",[116],
,
,1963–1968: Second quintet,[,edit,],
,  ,Davis performing in Antibes, France in July 1963,
,In December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left to join them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US$211,304 in 2019 dollars,[60],) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist ,George Coleman,, bassist ,Ron Carter,, pianist ,Victor Feldman,, and drummer ,Frank Butler,.,[117], By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist ,Herbie Hancock, and 17-year-old drummer ,Tony Williams, who made Davis ""excited all over again."",[118], With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became ,Seven Steps to Heaven, (1963) and recorded the live albums ,Miles Davis in Europe, (1964), ,My Funny Valentine, (1965), and ,Four & More, (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.
,In 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist ,Sam Rivers, until Davis persuaded ,Wayne Shorter, to leave ,Art Blakey,. This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and the album ,E.S.P., (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ,Miles in Berlin, (1965).,[119],
,Davis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.,[120], He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint.,[121], In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included ,gigs at the Plugged Nickel, in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his engineer and record producer after their rift over ,Quiet Nights, had healed.,[122],[123],

,
,In January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues.,[125], Columbia president ,Clive Davis, noted that in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise.,[126], After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of productive sessions. He started a relationship with actress ,Cicely Tyson,, who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.,[127],
,Material from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on ,Miles Smiles, (1966), ,Sorcerer, (1967), ,Nefertiti, (1967), ,Miles in the Sky, (1968), and ,Filles de Kilimanjaro, (1968). The quintet's approach to the new music became known as ""time no changes""—which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.,[128], Through ,Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.
,Miles in the Sky, and ,Filles de Kilimanjaro,—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the ,fusion, phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ,Filles de Kilimanjaro, was recorded, bassist ,Dave Holland, and pianist ,Chick Corea, had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.
,
,1968–1975: The electric period,[,edit,],
,  ,Davis performing in 1971,
,In September 1968, Davis married 23-year-old model and songwriter ,Betty Mabry,.,[129], In his autobiography, Davis described her as a ""high-class groupie, who was very talented but who didn't believe in her own talent."",[116], Mabry, a familiar face in the New York City counterculture, helped introduce Davis to popular rock, soul, and funk musicians.,[130], Jazz critic ,Leonard Feather, visited Davis's apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by ,The Byrds,, ,Aretha Franklin,, and ,Dionne Warwick,. He also liked ,James Brown,, ,Sly and the Family Stone,, and ,Jimi Hendrix,,,[131], whose group ,Band of Gypsys, particularly made an impression on Davis.,[132], Davis filed for divorce from Mabry in 1969, after accusing her of having an affair with Jimi Hendrix.,[116],
,In a Silent Way, (1969) was recorded in a single studio session on February 18, 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists ,Chick Corea, and ,Josef Zawinul, and guitarist ,John McLaughlin,. The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session.
When the album was released in July 1969, some critics accused him of ""selling out"" to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US ,Billboard, Top LPs, chart, his first album since ,My Funny Valentine, to reach the chart. ,In a Silent Way, was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Davis's ""lost quintet"".,[133],[134],
,In October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed.,[135], In 1970, Marguerite gave birth to their son Erin.
,For the double album ,Bitches Brew, (1970), he hired ,Jack DeJohnette,, ,Airto Moreira,, and ,Bennie Maupin,. The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis. Other studio techniques included splicing, multitrack recording, and tape loops.,[136], ,Bitches Brew, peaked at No. 35 on the ,Billboard, Album chart.,[137], In 1976 it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records. By 2003, it had sold one million copies.,[98],

,
,In March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for various rock acts, allowing Columbia to market ,Bitches Brew, to a larger audience. He was so offended by Clive Davis's suggestion to perform at the ,Fillmore East, that he threatened to switch record labels, but he reconsidered and shared a bill with the ,Steve Miller Band, and ,Neil Young, with ,Crazy Horse, on March 6 and 7.,[135], Biographer ,Paul Tingen, wrote, ""Miles' newcomer status in this environment"" led to ""mixed audience reactions, often having to play for dramatically reduced fees, and enduring the 'sell-out' accusations from the jazz world,"" as well as being ""...attacked by sections of the black press for supposedly genuflecting to white culture."",[140], The 1970 tours included the ,1970 Isle of Wight Festival, on August 29 when he performed to an estimated 600,000 people, the largest of his career.,[141], Plans to record with Hendrix ended after the guitarist's death; his funeral was the last that Davis attended.,[142], Several live albums with a transitional sextet/septet including Corea, DeJohnette, Holland, Moreira, saxophonist ,Steve Grossman,, and keyboardist ,Keith Jarrett, were recorded during this period, including ,Miles Davis at Fillmore, (1970) and ,Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, (1973).,[10],

,By 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year (US$631,306 in 2019 dollars,[60],) for three years in addition to royalties.,[143], He recorded a soundtrack album (1971's ,Jack Johnson,) for the ,1970 documentary film, about heavyweight boxer ,Jack Johnson,, containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin, ,Sonny Sharrock,, and ,Billy Cobham,. He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer ,Leon ""Ndugu"" Chancler, and percussionists ,James Mtume, and ,Don Alias,.,[144], ,Live-Evil, (1971) was released in the same month. Showcasing former Stevie Wonder touring bassist ,Michael Henderson,, who replaced Holland in the autumn of 1970, the album demonstrated that Davis's ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of ,Bitches Brew,.
,In 1972, composer-arranger ,Paul Buckmaster, introduced Davis to the music of German avant-garde composer ,Karlheinz Stockhausen,, leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, ""The effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally."",[145], His recordings and performances during this period were described as ""space music"" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as ""a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music."",[146],[147], The studio album ,On the Corner, (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero.,[148], The album reached No. 1 on the ,Billboard, jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. ,On the Corner, elicited a favorable review from ,Ralph J. Gleason, of ,Rolling Stone,,,[149], but Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. ""The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don't listen to those stations; they listen to R&B stations and some rock stations."",[150], In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain.,[151], Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, ""Everything started to blur."",[152],

,This was music that polarized audiences, provoking boos and walk-outs amid the ecstasy of others. The length, density, and unforgiving nature of it mocked those who said that Miles was interested only in being trendy and popular. Some have heard in this music the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death. As ,Theodor Adorno, said of the late ,Beethoven,, the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful.,
,— ,John Szwed, on ,Agharta, (1975) and ,Pangaea, (1976),[153],
,
,
,After recording ,On the Corner,, he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume, ,Carlos Garnett,, guitarist ,Reggie Lucas,, organist ,Lonnie Liston Smith,, tabla player ,Badal Roy,, sitarist ,Khalil Balakrishna,, and drummer ,Al Foster,. Only Smith was a  jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live for ,In Concert, (1973), but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist ,Pete Cosey,. The compilation studio album ,Big Fun, (1974) contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.
,Studio activity in the 1970s culminated in sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 for ,Get Up with It, (1974), a compilation that included four long pieces (comprising over ninety minutes of new music) alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The album contained ""He Loved Him Madly"", a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington that presaged later developments in ,ambient music,.,[154], In the United States, it performed comparably to ,On the Corner,, reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums ,Agharta, (1975), ,Pangaea, (1976), and ,Dark Magus, (1977). The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975 in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by pneumonia, osteoarthritis, sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, and stomach ulcers; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience.,[155], Cosey later asserted that ""the band really advanced after the Japanese tour"",,[156], but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock. Hancock had eclipsed his former employer from a commercial standpoint with ,Head Hunters, (1973) and ,Thrust, (1974), two albums that were marketed to pop audiences in the aftermath of the ,On the Corner, farrago and peaked at number 13 on the ,Billboard, pop chart.
,After appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the ,Schaefer Music Festival, in New York City on September 5, Davis dropped out of music.,[155],[157],
,
,1975–1980: Hiatus,[,edit,],
,In his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his ,Upper West Side, brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women.,[158], In December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation.,[159], In March 1976, ,Rolling Stone, reported rumors of his imminent demise, citing his health problems during the previous tour.,[160], In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with ,United Artists,, Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist ,Vladimir Horowitz, was the only other musician with Columbia who had a similar status.,[161],
,In 1978, Julie Coryell interviewed Davis. Concerned about his health, she had him stay with a friend in ,Norwalk, Connecticut,.,[162], Davis asked Coryell's husband, fusion guitarist ,Larry Coryell,, to participate in sessions with keyboardists ,Masabumi Kikuchi, and George Pavlis, bassist ,T. M. Stevens,, and drummer ,Al Foster,.,[162], Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the band's knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City.,[163],[164], Soon after, Marguerite Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son Erin, which cost him $10,000 (US$39,199 in 2019 dollars,[60],) for release on bail.,[162],[159], A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted,,[165], with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972.,[166], Despite the dearth of new material, Davis placed in the Top 10 trumpeter poll of ,Down Beat, magazine in 1979.
,
,  ,Davis and Cicely Tyson in 1982,
,By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress ,Cicely Tyson,, with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married on November 26, 1981, in a ceremony at ,Bill Cosby,'s home in Massachusetts that was officiated by politician and civil rights activist ,Andrew Young,.,[167],[168], Their tumultuous marriage ended with Tyson filing for divorce in 1988, which was finalized in 1989.,[169],
,In October 1979, his contract with Columbia was up for negotiation. Label president Clive Davis was replaced by ,George Butler,, who had visited Davis several times during the previous two years to encourage him to return to the studio. To help his situation, Davis had Buckmaster come over to collaborate on new music.,[170], After arriving, Buckmaster organized an ,intervention, for Davis, who was living in squalor among cockroach infestations, in the dark with his curtains always closed. His sister Dorothy cleaned his house with help from Buckmaster, Tyson, and neighbor ,Chaka Khan,. Davis later thanked Buckmaster for helping him.,[171],
,
,1980–1985: Comeback,[,edit,],
,Davis hadn't played the trumpet much for three years and found it difficult to reclaim his ,embouchure,. His first post-hiatus studio appearance took place on May 1, 1980.,[172], A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection.,[173], He recorded ,The Man with the Horn, (1981) from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist ,Bill Evans, (not to be confused with pianist ,Bill Evans,) and bassist ,Marcus Miller,. Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.
,The Man with the Horn, received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of ,Mel Lewis,'s band at the ,Village Vanguard,.,[174], This was followed by appearances with a new band, a four-night run at Kix in Boston, and two shows at Avery Fisher Hall on July 5 as part of the ,Kool Jazz Festival,.,[175],[176], Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including the Kix and Avery Fisher Hall gigs, were released on ,We Want Miles, (1982),,[177], which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.,[168],
,
,  ,Davis performing in 1985,
,In January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis ""went a little wild"" with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand.,[178],[179], Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctor's warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.,[178],
,Davis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included French percussionist ,Mino Cinelu, and guitarist ,John Scofield,, with whom he worked closely on the album ,Star People, (1983). In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for ,Decoy,, an album mixing soul music and ,electronica, that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist ,Robert Irving III,, who had collaborated with him on ,The Man with the Horn,. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and ,Darryl Jones,, he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the ,Léonie Sonning Music Prize,. Trumpeter ,Palle Mikkelborg, had written a contemporary classical piece titled ""Aura"" for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, ,Aura, (1989).,[180], Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.
,In May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with ,Warner Bros., that required him to give up his  publishing rights.,[181],[182], Trumpeter ,Wynton Marsalis, publicly dismissed his more recent fusion recordings as not being ""'true' jazz."" Davis shrugged off the comment, calling Marsalis ""a nice young man, only confused."" Marsalis appeared unannounced onstage during Davis' performance at the inaugural ,Vancouver International Jazz Festival, in 1986. Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that ""someone"" had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.,[183], Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbia's delay in releasing ,Aura,. The breaking point appears to have come when a producer at Columbia asked him to call Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday. The tour in 1985 included a performance in London in July in which Davis performed on stage for five hours. Jazz critic ,John Fordham, concluded, ""The leader is clearly enjoying himself."",[184], By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.,[185],
,He released ,You're Under Arrest,, his final album for Columbia, in September 1985. It included cover versions of two pop songs: "",Time After Time,"" by ,Cyndi Lauper, and ,Michael Jackson,'s "",Human Nature,."" He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of today's jazz standards had been pop songs in ,Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.
,Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including ,Scritti Politti,.,[186], At the invitation of producer ,Bill Laswell,, he recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd.'s ,Album,, according to ,John Lydon, in the liner notes of their ,Plastic Box, box set. In Lydon's words, however, ""Strangely enough, we didn't use [his contributions]."" According to Lydon in the ,Plastic Box, notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound during these sessions.,[187],
,
,1986–1991: Final years,[,edit,],
,  ,Davis performing in ,Strasbourg,, 1987,
,After taking part in the recording of the 1985 protest song "",Sun City,"" as a member of ,Artists United Against Apartheid,, Davis appeared on the instrumental ""Don't Stop Me Now"" by ,Toto, for their album ,Fahrenheit, (1986). Davis intended to collaborate with ,Prince,, but the project was dropped.,[188], Davis also collaborated with ,Zane Giles, and ,Randy Hall, on the ,Rubberband, sessions in 1985 but those would remain unreleased until 2019.,[189], Instead, he worked with Marcus Miller, and ,Tutu, (1986) became the first time he used modern studio tools such as programmed synthesizers, ,sampling,, and drum loops. Released in September 1986, its front cover is a portrait of Davis by ,Irving Penn,.,[182], In 1987, he won a Grammy Award for ,Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist,.
,In 1988, Davis had a small part as a street musician in the Christmas comedy film ,Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with ,Zucchero Fornaciari, in a version of ,Dune Mosse, (,Blue's,), published in 2004 in ,Zu & Co., of the Italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the ,Knights of Malta, at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain (hence the ""Sir"" title on his gravestone).,[190], Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home.,[191], Rumors of his health were made public after the American magazine ,Star,, in its February 21, 1989 edition, published that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting his manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day to deny the claim. Shukat revealed Davis had been in the hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a benign polyp on his vocal cords and was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours.,[192], Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action.,[193], He was interviewed on ,60 Minutes, by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, he received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor ,Jacques Chirac,.,[194], In 1990, he received a ,Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award,.,[195], In early 1991, he appeared in the ,Rolf de Heer, film ,Dingo, as a jazz musician.
,
,  ,Davis at the ,North Sea Jazz Festival,, 1991,
,Davis followed ,Tutu, with ,Amandla, (1989) and soundtracks to four films: ,Street Smart,, ,Siesta,, ,The Hot Spot,, and ,Dingo,., His last albums were released posthumously: the hip hop-influenced ,Doo-Bop, (1992) and ,Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, (1993), a collaboration with Quincy Jones from the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival where, for the first time in three decades, he performed songs from ,Miles Ahead,, ,Porgy and Bess,, and ,Sketches of Spain,.,[196],
,On July 8, 1991, Davis returned to performing material from his past at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival with a band and orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones.,[197], The set consisted of arrangements from his albums recorded with Gil Evans.,[198], The show was followed by a concert billed as ""Miles and Friends"" at the ,Grande halle de la Villette, in Paris two days later, with guest performances by musicians from throughout his career, including John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul.,[198], In Paris, he was awarded the ,Chevalier of the Legion of Honor,.,[195], After returning to America, he stopped in New York City to record material for ,Doo-Bop,, then returned to California to play at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25, his final live performance.,[197],[199],
,
,Death,[,edit,],
,  ,Davis's grave in ,Woodlawn Cemetery,
,In early September 1991, Davis checked into ,St. John's Hospital, near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests.,[200], Doctors suggested he have a ,tracheal tube, implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of ,bronchial pneumonia,. The suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an ,intracerebral hemorrhage, followed by a coma. After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991.,[201], He was 65 years old. His death was attributed to the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.,[10], According to Troupe, Davis was taking ,azidothymidine, (AZT), a type of ,antiretroviral drug, used for the treatment of ,HIV, and ,AIDS,, during his treatments in hospital.,[202], A funeral service was held on October 5, 1991, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church on ,Lexington Avenue, in New York City,[203],[204], that was attended by around 500 friends, family members, and musical acquaintances, with many fans standing in the rain.,[205], He was buried in ,Woodlawn Cemetery, in ,the Bronx,, New York City, with one of his trumpets, near the site of ,Duke Ellington,'s grave.,[206],[205], 
,At the time of his death, Davis' estate was valued at more than $1 million. In his will, Davis left 20 percent to his daughter Cheryl Davis; 40 percent to his son Erin Davis; 10 percent to nephew Vincent Wilburn Jr. and 15 percent each to his brother Vernon Davis and his sister Dorothy Wilburn. He excluded his two sons Gregory and Miles IV.,[207],
,
,Views on his earlier work,[,edit,],
,Late in his life, from the ""electric period"" onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as ,Birth of the Cool, or ,Kind of Blue,. In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option.,[208], He commented: ,"",'So What' or ,Kind of Blue,, they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. It's over ... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, it's more like warmed-over turkey."",[209], When ,Shirley Horn, insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his ,Kind of Blue, period, he demurred. ""Nah, it hurts my lip,"" was the reason he gave.,[209], ,Bill Evans,, who played piano on ,Kind of Blue,, said: ""I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience."",[209],
,
,Legacy and influence,[,edit,],
,  ,Statue in ,Kielce,, Poland,
,Miles Davis is considered one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music. ,The Guardian, described him as ""a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz."",[210], He has been called ""one of the great innovators in jazz"",,[211], and had the titles Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him.,[212], ,The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, said, ""Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music."",[213],
,William Ruhlmann of ,AllMusic, wrote, ""To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period ... It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward."",[1], Music writer Christopher Smith wrote,
,
,Miles Davis' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. ... Miles' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.,
,His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.,[214],
,
,  ,The westernmost part of 77th Street in New York City has been named Miles Davis Way. He once lived on the block.,
,Kind of Blue, remains the best-selling jazz album of all time. On November 5, 2009, U.S. Representative ,John Conyers, of Michigan sponsored a measure in the United States House of Representatives to commemorate the album on its 50th anniversary. The measure also affirms jazz as a national treasure and ""encourages the United States government to preserve and advance the art form of jazz music."",[215], It passed with a vote of 409–0 on December 15, 2009.,[216], The trumpet Davis used on the recording is displayed on the campus of the ,University of North Carolina, at ,Greensboro,. It was donated to the school by Arthur ""Buddy"" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.,[217],
,In 1986, the ,New England Conservatory, awarded Davis an ,honorary doctorate, for his contributions to music.,[218], Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (,NARAS,) honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.
,In 2001 a two-hour documentary film by ,Mike Dibb, entitled ,The Miles Davis Story, won an ,International Emmy Award, for arts documentary of the year.,[219],
,Miles Ahead, was a 2015 American music film directed by ,Don Cheadle,, co-written by Cheadle with ,Steven Baigelman,, Stephen J. Rivele, and ,Christopher Wilkinson,, which interprets the life and compositions of Davis. It premiered at the ,New York Film Festival, in October 2015. The film stars Cheadle, ,Emayatzy Corinealdi, as Frances Taylor, ,Ewan McGregor,, ,Michael Stuhlbarg,, and ,Lakeith Stanfield,.,[220],
,In 2019, the documentary ,Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool,, directed by ,Stanley Nelson,, premiered at the ,Sundance Film Festival,.,[221],

,Earl Rudolph, "",Bud,"" ,Powell, (September 27, 1924 – July 31, 1966) was an American ,jazz, pianist. Though ,Thelonious Monk, was a close friend and influence, his greatest piano influence was ,Art Tatum,.,[,citation needed,],
,Along with ,Charlie Parker,, ,Thelonious Monk,, and ,Dizzy Gillespie,, Powell was a leading figure in the development of modern jazz, or ,bebop,. His virtuosity led many to call him the Charlie Parker of the piano. Powell was also a composer, and many jazz critics credit his works and his playing as having ""greatly extended the range of jazz harmony."",[1],

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Powell's father was a ,stride pianist,.,[2], Powell started classical piano lessons at the age of five.,[3], His teacher, hired by his father, was a West Indian man named Rawlins.,[4], At ten, Powell showed interest in the ,swing music, that could be heard all over the neighborhood. He first appeared in public at a ,rent party,,,[5], where he mimicked ,Fats Waller,'s playing style. The first jazz composition that he mastered was ,James P. Johnson,'s ""Carolina Shout"".,[6], Powell's older brother, William, played trumpet and violin, and by the age of 15 Powell was playing in William's band.,[7], Powell heard ,Art Tatum, on the radio and tried to match his technique.,[6], Powell's younger brother, ,Richie Powell,, was also a noted be-bop pianist.
,
,Later life and career,[,edit,],
,Early to mid-1940s,[,edit,],
,In his youth Powell listened to the adventurous performances at Uptown House, a venue near his home. This was where ,Charlie Parker, first appeared as a solo act when he briefly lived in New York.,[8], ,Thelonious Monk, played at Uptown House. When Monk met Powell,[9], he introduced Powell to musicians who were starting to play bebop at  ,Minton's Playhouse,. Monk was a resident pianist, and he presented Powell as his protégé. Their mutual affection grew, and Monk became Powell's greatest mentor. Powell eagerly experimented with Monk's idea. Monk's composition "",In Walked Bud,"" is a tribute to their time together in Harlem.,[10], Powell was engaged in a series of dance bands, his incubation culminating in becoming the pianist for the swing orchestra of ,Cootie Williams,. In late 1943 he was offered the chance to appear at a nightclub with the quintet of ,Oscar Pettiford, and ,Dizzy Gillespie,, but Powell's mother decided he would continue with the more secure job with the popular Williams.,[11],
,Powell was the pianist on a handful of Williams's recording dates in 1944. The last included the first recording of Monk's "",'Round Midnight,"".,[12], His job with Williams was terminated in Philadelphia in January 1945. After the band finished for the night, Powell wandered near Broad Street Station and was apprehended, drunk, by the private railroad police. He was beaten by them and incarcerated briefly by the city police. Ten days after his release, his headaches persisted and he was hospitalized at ,Bellevue,, an observation ward, and then in a state psychiatric hospital sixty miles away. He remained there for two and a half months.,[13],
,Powell resumed playing in Manhattan after released.,[11], In 1945–46 he recorded with ,Frank Socolow,, ,Sarah Vaughan,, ,Dexter Gordon,, ,J. J. Johnson,, ,Sonny Stitt,, ,Fats Navarro,, and ,Kenny Clarke,.,[14], Powell became known for his sight-reading and his skill at fast tempos.,[14], On January 10, 1947, Powell recorded his first session as a leader, which included 8 pieces for ,De Luxe Records, with ,Max Roach, and ,Curly Russell, as accompanists. The recordings were unreleased until 1949, when ,Roost Records, bought the masters and released them on a series of 78 rpm records. Musicologist Guthrie Ramsey wrote of the session that ""Powell proves himself the equal of any of the other beboppers in technique, versatility, and feeling."",[15],
,Charlie Parker chose Powell to be his pianist on a May 1947 quintet recording session with ,Miles Davis,, ,Tommy Potter,, and ,Max Roach,; this was the only studio session in which Parker and Powell played together.,[16],
,
,Hospitalization (1947–1948),[,edit,],
,The Parker session aside, Powell performed on two other records and seldom appeared at nightclubs in 1947. In November, he had an altercation with a customer at a bar in Harlem. In the ensuing fight, Powell was hit over his eye with a bottle. When the staff at Harlem Hospital found him incoherent and rambunctious, they sent him to Bellevue, which had a record of his previous confinements. He was sent to ,Creedmoor State Hospital,, where he spent eleven months.,[17], Powell adjusted to being in the hospital, though in psychiatric interviews he expressed feelings of persecution founded in racism.,[18], From February to April 1948, he received ,electroconvulsive therapy,[11], after an outburst which may have been prompted by learning from his girlfriend that she was pregnant with their child.,[19], The electroconvulsive therapy was considered ineffective, so the doctors gave him a second series of treatments in May. He was released in October 1948.,[11],
,
,Solo and trio recordings (1949–1958),[,edit,],
,After a brief hospitalization in early 1949,,[11], Powell made several recordings, most of them for ,Blue Note,,,[20], ,Mercury,, Norgran, and Clef.,[21], The first Blue Note session in August 1949 included ,Fats Navarro,, ,Sonny Rollins,, ,Tommy Potter, and ,Roy Haynes,, and the compositions ""Bouncing with Bud"" and ""Dance of the Infidels"". The second Blue Note session in 1951 was a trio with Curley Russell and Max Roach and included ""Parisian Thoroughfare"" and "",Un Poco Loco,"".,[14], The latter was selected by literary critic ,Harold Bloom, for his short list of the ,greatest works of twentieth-century American art,.,[22], Sessions for Granz included ,Ray Brown,, ,George Duvivier,, ,Percy Heath,, Roach, Russell, ,Lloyd Trotman,, ,Art Blakey,, ,Kenny Clarke,, ,Osie Johnson,, ,Buddy Rich,, and ,Art Taylor,.,[14],
,Powell's rivalry with Parker led to feuding and bitterness on the bandstand.,[23], Contributing factors were Powell's worsening mental and physical health.,[24], Powell recorded for Blue Note and Granz throughout the 1950s, interrupted by another stay in a mental hospital from late 1951 to early 1953 after being arrested for possession of marijuana. He was released into the guardianship of Oscar Goodstein, owner of the ,Birdland, nightclub. A 1953 trio session for Blue Note with Duvivier and Taylor included Powell's composition "",Glass Enclosure,"", inspired by his near-imprisonment in Goodstein's apartment.,[25], On May 15, 1953 he played at ,Massey Hall, in ,Toronto, with the quintet, including ,Charlie Parker,, ,Dizzy Gillespie,, ,Charles Mingus,, and ,Max Roach,. The performance was recorded and released by ,Debut Records, as the album  ,Jazz at Massey Hall,.,[14], After being released from the hospital, his piano playing was negatively affected by the ,Largactil, he was taking as treatment for ,schizophrenia,.,[25],  In 1956 his brother ,Richie Powell, and trumpeter ,Clifford Brown, were killed in a car crash.,[26],
,
,Paris (1959–1963),[,edit,],
,After several more periods in the hospital, Powell moved to Paris in 1959 with Altevia ""Buttercup"" Edwards, whom he had met after an incarceration in 1954.,[27], The couple moved into the ,Hotel La Louisiane,.,[28], She managed his finances and his medicine. Powell continued to perform and record.
,
,Last years (1964–1966),[,edit,],
,In 1963, Powell contracted ,tuberculosis,. During the next year, he returned to New York to perform at Birdland with drummer ,Horace Arnold, and bassist ,John Ore,. His performances during these years were adversely affected by his alcoholism.,[16], His emotions became unbalanced, and he was hospitalized in New York after months of erratic behavior and self-neglect. On July 31, 1966, he died of tuberculosis, malnutrition, and alcoholism.,[29],
,
,Musical style,[,edit,],
,Jazz pianist ,Bill Cunliffe, said Powell was ""the first pianist to take Charlie Parker's language and adapt it successfully to the piano."",[30], His melodic lines were influenced by ,Billy Kyle,[31], and his accompaniment of horn solos was influenced by ,Earl Hines,, Teddy Wilson, and ,stride, piano.,[32], His comping often consisted of single bass notes outlining the ,root, and ,fifth,. He used voicings of the root and the ,tenth, or the root with the ,minor seventh,.,[33], He was influenced by Monk and Art Tatum.,[34], His solos imitated the attack of horn players, with frequent arpeggios punctuated by ,chromaticism,.,[16], This was, in part, due to his desire to see the pianist get the adulation usually reserved for the saxophonist or trumpeter.,[35], Powell freed the right hand for continuous linear exploration at the expense of developing the left.,[36],  Powell dictated the time when he played, in particular throughout the eight-notes in his right hand, participating in the time-keeping with the bassist and drummer. This is reminiscent of recordings of Charlie Parker.,[37],
,
,Influence,[,edit,],
,In 1986 Francis Paudras wrote a book about his friendship with Powell, translated into English in 1997 as ,Dance of the Infidels: A Portrait of Bud Powell,.,[38], The book was the basis for ,Round Midnight,, a film inspired by the lives of Powell and ,Lester Young,, in which ,Dexter Gordon, played the lead role of an expatriate jazzman in Paris.,[39], In February 2012 a biography titled ,Wail: The Life of Bud Powell, by Peter Pullman was released as an ebook.,[11],
,Powell influenced countless younger musicians, especially pianists. These included ,Horace Silver,,,[40], ,Wynton Kelly,,,[41], ,Andre Previn,,,[42], ,McCoy Tyner,,,[43], ,Cedar Walton,,,[44], and ,Chick Corea,.,[45],
,Bill Evans,, who described Powell as his single greatest influence,,[46], paid the pianist a tribute in 1979: ""If I had to choose one single musician for his artistic integrity, for the incomparable originality of his creation and the grandeur of his work, it would be Bud Powell. He was in a class by himself"".,[47],
,Herbie Hancock, said of Powell, in a ,Down Beat, magazine interview in 1966: ""He was the foundation out of which stemmed the whole edifice of modern jazz piano"".,[48],

,Life and career,[,edit,],
,Ruth Lee Jones was born in ,Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Alice and Ollie Jones,,[4], and moved to ,Chicago, as a child. She became deeply involved in gospel and played piano for the choir in St. Luke's Baptist Church while still in elementary school. She sang ,gospel music, in church and played piano, directing her church choir in her teens and being a member of the Sallie Martin Gospel Singers.,[5], When she joined the Sallie Martin group, she dropped out of ,Wendell Phillips High School,. She sang lead with the first female gospel singers formed by ,Sallie Martin,, who was co-founder of the Gospel Singers Convention. Her involvement with the gospel choir occurred after she won an amateur contest at Chicago's ,Regal Theater, where she sang ""I Can't Face the Music"".,[6],
,After winning a talent contest at the age of 15, she began performing in clubs. By 1941–42 she was performing in such Chicago clubs as Dave's Café and the Downbeat Room of the Sherman Hotel (with ,Fats Waller,). She was playing at the Three Deuces, a jazz club, when a friend took her to hear ,Billie Holiday, at the Garrick Stage Bar. Club owner Joe Sherman was so impressed with her singing of "",I Understand,"", backed by the ,Cats and the Fiddle,, who were appearing in the Garrick's upstairs room, that he hired her. During her year at the Garrick – she sang upstairs while Holiday performed in the downstairs room – she acquired the name by which she became known. She credited Joe Sherman with suggesting the change from Ruth Jones, made before ,Lionel Hampton, came to hear Dinah at the Garrick.,[6], Hampton's visit brought an offer, and Washington worked as his female band vocalist after she had sung with the band for its opening at the Chicago Regal Theatre.
,
She made her recording debut for the ,Keynote, label that December with ""Evil Gal Blues"", written by ,Leonard Feather, and backed by Hampton and musicians from his band, including ,Joe Morris, (trumpet) and ,Milt Buckner, (piano).,[1],[7],[8], Both that record and its follow-up, ""Salty Papa Blues"", made the ,Billboard, ,""Harlem Hit Parade"", in 1944.,[9],  In December 1945 she made a series of twelve recordings for ,Apollo Records,, 10 of which were issued, featuring the "",Lucky Thompson, All Stars."",[10],  ,Dinah Washington in 1952,She stayed with Hampton's band until 1946, after the Keynote label folded, signed for ,Mercury Records, as a solo singer. Her first record for Mercury, a version of ,Fats Waller,'s "",Ain't Misbehavin',"", was another hit, starting a long string of success. Between 1948 and 1955, she had 27 R&B top ten hits, making her one of the most popular and successful singers of the period. Both ""Am I Asking Too Much"" (1948) and "",Baby Get Lost,"" (1949) reached Number 1 on the R&B chart, and her version of "",I Wanna Be Loved,"" (1950) ,crossed over, to reach Number 22 on the ,US pop chart,.,[9], Her hit recordings included blues, standards, novelties, pop covers, and even a version of ,Hank Williams,' "",Cold, Cold Heart,"" (R&B Number 3, 1951). At the same time as her biggest popular success, she also recorded sessions with many leading jazz musicians, including ,Clifford Brown, and ,Clark Terry, on the album ,Dinah Jams, (1954), and also recorded with ,Cannonball Adderley, and ,Ben Webster,.,[1],[8],
,In 1950, Dinah Washington performed at the sixth famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at ,Wrigley Field, in Los Angeles which was produced by ,Leon Hefflin, Sr., on June 25. Also featured on the same day were ,Lionel Hampton,, ,PeeWee Crayton's, Orchestra, ,Roy Milton, and his Orchestra, ,Tiny Davis and Her Hell Divers,, and other artists. 16,000 were reported to be in attendance and the concert ended early because of a fracas while Lionel Hampton played ""Flying High"".,[11],[12], Washington came back to perform at the twelfth ,Cavalcade of Jazz, also at ,Wrigley Field, in Los Angeles on September 2, 1956.  Also performing that day were ,Little Richard,, The Mel Williams Dots, Julie Stevens, ,Chuck Higgin's, Orchestra, ,Bo Rhambo,, Willie Hayden & Five Black Birds, The Premiers, ,Gerald Wilson, and His 20-Pc. Recording Orchestra and ,Jerry Gray, and his Orchestra.,[13],
,In 1959, she had her first top ten pop hit, with a version of "",What a Diff'rence a Day Made,"",,[14], which made Number 4 on the US pop chart.  Her band at that time included arranger ,Belford Hendricks,, with ,Kenny Burrell, (guitar), ,Joe Zawinul, (piano), and ,Panama Francis, (drums).  She followed it up with a version of ,Irving Gordon,'s "",Unforgettable,"", and then two highly successful duets in 1960 with ,Brook Benton,, "",Baby (You've Got What It Takes),"" (No. 5 Pop, No. 1 R&B) and "",A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall in Love),"" (No. 7 Pop, No. 1 R&B).  Her last big hit was "",September in the Rain,"" in 1961 (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 R&B).,[9],
,She also notably performed two numbers in the ,dirty blues, genre. The songs were ""Long John Blues"" about her ,dentist,, with lyrics like ,""He took out his trusty drill. Told me to open wide. He said he wouldn't hurt me, but he filled my whole inside."",[15],  She also recorded a song called ""Big Long Sliding Thing"", supposedly about a trombonist.,[16],
,In the 1950s and early 1960s before her death, Washington occasionally performed on the ,Las Vegas Strip,. ,Tony Bennett, said of Washington during a recording session with ,Amy Winehouse,: ""She was a good friend of mine, you know. She was great. She used to just come in with two suitcases in Vegas without being booked. And she'd just come in and put the suitcases down. And she'd say ""I'm here, boss"". And she'd stay as long as she wanted. And all the kids in all the shows on the Strip would come that night. They'd hear that she's in town and it would be packed just for her performance"". According to Richard S. Ginell at ,AllMusic,:,[1],
,
,[Washington] was at once one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the mid-20th century – beloved to her fans, devotees, and fellow singers; controversial to critics who still accuse her of selling out her art to commerce and bad taste. Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R&B, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and she probably would have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing...,
,Washington was well known for singing ,torch songs,.,[17], In 1962, Dinah hired a male backing trio called the Allegros, consisting of Jimmy Thomas on drums, Earl Edwards on sax, and Jimmy Sigler on organ. Edwards was replaced on sax by John Payne. A ,Variety, writer praised their vocals as ""effective choruses"".,[6],
,Washington's achievements included appearances at the ,Newport Jazz Festival, (1955–59), the Randalls Island Jazz Festival in New York City (1959), and the International Jazz Festival in ,Washington D.C., (1962), frequent gigs at ,Birdland, (1958, 1961–62), and performances in 1963 with ,Count Basie, and ,Duke Ellington,.
,
,Death,[,edit,],
,Early in the morning of December 14, 1963, Washington's seventh husband, football great ,Dick ""Night Train"" Lane,, went to sleep with Washington and awoke later to find her slumped over and not responsive. Doctor B. C. Ross came to the scene to pronounce her dead.,[6], An autopsy later showed a lethal combination of ,secobarbital, and ,amobarbital,, prescriptions for her insomnia and diet, which contributed to her death at the age of 39.,[18], She is buried in the ,Burr Oak Cemetery, in ,Alsip, Illinois,.

,""Playing music was a great escape for me from the poverty."",
,Goodman, in a 1975 interview,[3],
,
,
,Goodman was the ninth of twelve children born to poor Jewish emigrants from the ,Russian Empire,. His father, David Goodman (1873–1926), came to America in 1892 from ,Warsaw, in ,partitioned Poland, and became a tailor.,[1], His mother, Dora Grisinsky,,[1], (1873–1964), came from ,Kovno,. They met in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to Chicago before Goodman's birth. With little income and a large family, they moved to the ,Maxwell Street, neighborhood, an overcrowded slum near railroad yards and factories that was populated by German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Scandinavian, and Jewish immigrants.,[3],
,Money was a constant problem. On Sundays, his father took the children to free band concerts in ,Douglas Park,, which was the first time Goodman experienced live professional performances. To give his children some skills and an appreciation for music, his father enrolled ten-year-old Goodman and two of his brothers in music lessons, from 1919, at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue,[4], and Benny received two years of instruction from the classically trained clarinettist,and Chicago Symphony member, Franz Schoepp.,[5],[6],[7], During the next year Goodman joined the boys club band at ,Hull House,, where he received lessons from director James Sylvester. By joining the band, he was entitled to spend two weeks at a summer camp near Chicago. It was the only time he could get away from his bleak neighborhood.,[3], At 13, he got his first union card.,[8], He performed on Lake Michigan excursion boats, and in 1923 played at Guyon’s Paradise, a local dance hall.,[9],
,In summer 1923, he met ,Bix Beiderbecke,.,[5], He attended the Lewis Institute (,Illinois Institute of Technology,) in 1924 as a high-school sophomore and played clarinet in a dance hall band.
,When he was 17, his father was killed by a passing car after stepping off a streetcar.,[10], His father's death was ""the saddest thing that ever happened in our family"", Goodman said.,[3],:,42,
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,His early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists who worked in Chicago, such as ,Jimmie Noone,,,[11], ,Johnny Dodds,, and ,Leon Roppolo,. He learned quickly, becoming a strong player at an early age, and was soon playing in bands. He made his professional debut in 1921 at the Central Park Theater on the West Side of Chicago. He entered ,Harrison Technical High School, in Chicago in 1922. At fourteen he became a member of the musicians' union and worked in a band featuring ,Bix Beiderbecke,.,[12], Two years later he joined the ,Ben Pollack, Orchestra and made his first recordings in 1926.,[11],
,
,From sideman to bandleader,[,edit,],
,Goodman moved to New York City and became a session musician for radio, Broadway musicals, and in studios.,[13], In addition to clarinet, he sometimes played alto saxophone and baritone saxophone.,[11], In a ,Victor, recording session on March 21, 1928, he played alongside ,Glenn Miller,, ,Tommy Dorsey,, and ,Joe Venuti, in the All-Star Orchestra directed by ,Nathaniel Shilkret,.,[14],[15],[16], He played with the bands of  ,Red Nichols,, ,Ben Selvin,, ,Ted Lewis,, and ,Isham Jones, and recorded for ,Brunswick, under the name Benny Goodman's Boys, a band that featured Glenn Miller. In 1928, Goodman and Miller wrote "",Room 1411,"", which was released as a Brunswick 78.,[17],
,He reached the charts for the first time when he recorded ""He's Not Worth Your Tears"" with a vocal by ,Scrappy Lambert, for ,Melotone,. After signing with ,Columbia, in 1934, he had top ten hits with ""Ain't Cha Glad?"" and ""I Ain't Lazy, I'm Just Dreamin'"" sung by ,Jack Teagarden,, ""Ol' Pappy"" sung by ,Mildred Bailey,, and ""Riffin' the Scotch"" sung by ,Billie Holiday,. An invitation to play at the Billy Rose Music Hall led to his creation of an orchestra for the four-month engagement. The orchestra recorded "",Moonglow,"", which became a number one hit and was followed by the Top Ten hits ""Take My Word"" and "",Bugle Call Rag,"".,[13],
,NBC hired Goodman for the radio program ,Let's Dance,.,[13], ,John Hammond, asked ,Fletcher Henderson, if he wanted to write arrangements for Goodman, and Henderson agreed.,[3],:,114, During the Depression, Henderson disbanded his orchestra because he was in debt.,[18], Goodman hired Henderson's band members to teach his musicians how to play the music.,[19],
,Goodman's band was one of three to perform on ,Let's Dance,, playing arrangements by Henderson along with hits such as "",Get Happy,"" and "",Limehouse Blues,"" by ,Spud Murphy,.,[20],
,Goodman's portion of the program was broadcast too late at night to attract a large audience on the east coast. He and his band remained on ,Let's Dance, until May of that year when a strike by employees of the series' sponsor, ,Nabisco,, forced the cancellation of the radio show. An engagement was booked at Manhattan's Roosevelt Grill filling in for ,Guy Lombardo,, but the audience expected ""sweet"" music and Goodman's band was unsuccessful.,[21],
,Goodman spent six months performing on ,Let's Dance,, and during that time he recorded six more Top Ten hits for Columbia.,[13],

,On July 31, 1935, "",King Porter Stomp,"" was released with "",Sometimes I'm Happy,"" on the B-side, both arranged by Henderson and recorded on July 1.,[3],:,134, In Pittsburgh at the ,Stanley Theater, some members of the audience danced in the aisles.,[22], But these arrangements had little impact on the tour until August 19 at McFadden's Ballroom in Oakland, California.,[23], Goodman and his band, which included ,Bunny Berrigan,, drummer ,Gene Krupa,, and singer  ,Helen Ward, were met by a large crowd of young dancers who cheered the music they had heard on ,Let's Dance,.,[24], ,Herb Caen, wrote, ""from the first note, the place was in an uproar."",[25], One night later, at ,Pismo Beach,, the show was a flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke.,[21], ,[a],
,The next night, August 21, 1935, at the ,Palomar Ballroom, in Los Angeles, Goodman and his band began a three-week engagement. On top of the ,Let's Dance, airplay, Al Jarvis had been playing Goodman's records on ,KFWB, radio.,[26], Goodman started the evening with stock arrangements, but after an indifferent response, he began the second set with arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and Spud Murphy. According to Willard Alexander, the band's booking agent, Krupa said, ""If we're gonna die, Benny, let's die playing our own thing."",[27], The crowd broke into cheers and applause. News reports spread word of the exciting music and enthusiastic dancing.,[21], The Palomar engagement was such a marked success that it is often described as the beginning of the ,swing era,.,[21], According to ,Donald Clarke,, ""It is clear in retrospect that the Swing Era  had been waiting to happen, but it was Goodman and his band that touched it off."",[21],
,The reception of American swing was less enthusiastic in Europe. British author ,J. C. Squire, filed a complaint with BBC radio to demand it stop playing Goodman's music, which he called ""an awful series of jungle noises which can hearten no man."",[3],:,243, Germany's Nazi party barred jazz from the radio, claiming it was part of a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the culture. Italy's fascist government banned the broadcast of any music composed or played by Jews which they said threatened ""the flower of our race, the youth."",[3],:,244,
,In November 1935 Goodman accepted an invitation to play in Chicago at the ,Joseph Urban, Room at the Congress Hotel. His stay there extended to six months, and his popularity was cemented by nationwide radio broadcasts over NBC affiliate stations. While in Chicago, the band recorded ,If I Could Be with You,, ,Stompin' at the Savoy,, and ,Goody, Goody,.,[21], Goodman also played three concerts produced by Chicago socialite and jazz aficionado ,Helen Oakley,. These ""Rhythm Club"" concerts at the Congress Hotel included sets in which Goodman and Krupa sat in with Fletcher Henderson's band, perhaps the first ,racially integrated, big band appearing before a paying audience in the United States.,[21], Goodman and Krupa played in a trio with ,Teddy Wilson, on piano. Both combinations were well received, and Wilson remained.
,In his 1935–1936 radio broadcasts from Chicago, Goodman was introduced as the ""Rajah of Rhythm."",[27], ,Slingerland Drum Company, had been calling Krupa the ""King of Swing"" as part of a sales campaign, but shortly after Goodman and his crew left Chicago in May 1936 to spend the summer filming ,The Big Broadcast of 1937, in Hollywood, the title ""King of Swing"" was applied to Goodman by the media.,[21],
,At the end of June 1936, Goodman went to Hollywood, where, on June 30, 1936, his band began CBS's ,Camel Caravan,,, its third and (according to Connor and Hicks) its greatest sponsored radio show, co-starring Goodman and his former boss Nathaniel Shilkret.,[14],[15], By spring 1936, Fletcher Henderson was writing arrangements for Goodman's band.,[12],
,
,Carnegie Hall concert,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert,
,In late 1937, Goodman's publicist Wynn Nathanson suggested that Goodman and his band play ,Carnegie Hall, in New York City. The sold-out concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It is regarded as one of the most significant in jazz history. After years of work by musicians from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences. Recordings of the concert were made, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was not of the finest quality. ,Acetate, recordings of the concert were made, and aluminum studio masters were cut.,[28], ""The recording was produced by Albert Marx as a special gift for his wife, Helen Ward, and a second set for Benny. He contracted Artists Recording Studio to make two sets. Artists Recording only had two turntables so they farmed out the second set to Raymond Scott's recording studio....It was Benny's sister-in-law who found the recordings in Benny's apartment [in 1950] and brought them to Benny's attention.,[3],:,366, Goodman took the discovered recording to Columbia, and a selection was issued on LP as ,The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert,.
,
,Charlie Christian,[,edit,],
,Pianist and arranger ,Mary Lou Williams, suggested to Hammond that he see guitarist ,Charlie Christian,.,[29], Hammond had seen Christian perform in Oklahoma City in 1939 and recommended him to Goodman, but Goodman was uninterested in electric guitar and was put off by Christian's taste in gaudy clothing. During a break at a concert in Beverly Hills, Hammond inserted Christian into the band. Goodman started playing "",Rose Room,"" on the assumption that Christian didn't know it, but his performance impressed everyone.,[30], Christian was a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet from 1939 to 1941, and during these two years he turned the electric guitar into a popular jazz instrument.,[31],
,
,Decline of swing,[,edit,],
,  ,Goodman in ,Stage Door Canteen, (1943),
,Goodman continued his success throughout the late 1930s with his ,big band,, his trio and quartet, and the sextet formed in August 1939, the same month Goodman returned to Columbia Records after four years with ,RCA Victor,. At Columbia, John Hammond, his future brother-in-law, produced most of his sessions. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands had lost much of their popularity. In 1941, ,ASCAP, had a licensing war with music publishers. From 1942 to 1944 and again in 1948, the musicians' union went on strike against the major record labels in the United States, and singers acquired the popularity that the big bands had once enjoyed. During the 1942–44 strike, the War Department approached the union and requested the production of ,V-Discs,, a set of records containing new recordings for soldiers to listen to, thereby boosting the rise of new artists,[32], Also, by the late 1940s, swing was no longer the dominant style of jazz musicians.,[33],
,
,Exploring bebop,[,edit,],
,By the 1940s, some jazz musicians were borrowing from classical music, while others, such as ,Charlie Parker,, were broadening the rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic vocabulary of swing to create ,bebop, (or bop). The bebop recordings Goodman made for ,Capitol, were praised by critics. For his bebop band he hired ,Buddy Greco,, ,Zoot Sims,, and ,Wardell Gray,.,[34], He consulted his friend Mary Lou Williams for advice on how to approach the music of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Pianist ,Mel Powell, was also an adviser in 1945.,[34], Goodman enjoyed bebop. When he heard ,Thelonious Monk,, he said, ""I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I like the way he played it....I think he's got a sense of humor and he's got some good things there."",[34], He also admired Swedish clarinetist ,Stan Hasselgard,. But after playing with a bebop band for over a year, he returned to his swing band because he concluded that was what he knew best.,[35], In 1953, he said, ""Maybe bop has done more to set music back for years than anything....Basically it's all wrong. It's not even knowing the scales....Bop was mostly publicity and people figuring angles."",[3],:,354,
,
,Classical repertoire,[,edit,],
,In 1949 he studied with clarinetist ,Reginald Kell,, requiring a change in technique: ""instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques. He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again—almost from scratch."",[36],
,Goodman commissioned compositions for clarinet and chamber ensembles or orchestra that have become standard pieces of classical repertoire. He premiered works by composers, such as ,Contrasts, by Béla Bartók; ,Clarinet Concerto No. 2, Op. 115, by ,Malcolm Arnold,; ,Derivations for Clarinet and Band, by ,Morton Gould,; ,Sonata for Clarinet and Piano, by Francis Poulenc, and ,Clarinet Concerto, by Aaron Copland. ,Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs, by Leonard Bernstein was commissioned for ,Woody Herman,'s big band, but it was premiered by Goodman. Herman was the dedicatee (1945) and first performer (1946) of Igor Stravinsky's ,Ebony Concerto,, but many years later Stravinsky made another recording with Goodman as the soloist.,[37],
,He made a recording of Mozart's ,Clarinet Quintet, in July 1956 with the ,Boston Symphony String Quartet, at the ,Berkshire Festival,; on the same occasion he recorded Mozart's ,Clarinet Concerto in A major,, K. 622, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by ,Charles Munch,. He also recorded the clarinet concertos of ,Weber,[3],:,324,
,After forays outside swing, Goodman started a new band in 1953. According to Donald Clarke, this was not a happy time for Goodman. He reunited the band to tour with Louis Armstrong. But he insulted Armstrong and ""was appalled at the vaudeville aspects of Louis's act...a contradiction of everything Goodman stood for"".,[21], Armstrong left Goodman hanging during a joint performance where Goodman called Armstrong back onstage to wrap up the show. Armstrong refused to perform alongside Goodman, which led essentially to the end of their friendship.
,Goodman's band appeared as a specialty act in the films ,The Big Broadcast of 1937,; ,Hollywood Hotel, (1938); ,Syncopation, (1942); ,The Powers Girl, (1942); ,Stage Door Canteen, (1943); ,The Gang's All Here, (1943); ,Sweet and Low-Down, (1944), Goodman's only starring feature; ,Make Mine Music, (1946),[38], and ,A Song Is Born, (1948).
,
,Later years,[,edit,],
,  ,Goodman in concert in Nuremberg, Germany (1971),
,He continued to play on records and in small groups. In the early 1970s he collaborated with ,George Benson, after the two met taping a PBS tribute to John Hammond, recreating some of Goodman's  duets with Charlie Christian.,[3],:,434, Benson appeared on Goodman's album ,Seven Come Eleven,. Goodman continued to play swing, but he practiced and performed classical pieces and commissioned them for clarinet. In 1960 he performed Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with conductor ,Alfredo Antonini, at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.,[39],[40],  Despite health problems, he continued to play until his death from a heart attack in 1986. He died at the age of 77 at ,Manhattan House,.,[41],
,
,Personal life,[,edit,],
,One of Goodman's closest friends was Columbia producer John Hammond, who influenced Goodman's move from Victor to Columbia.,[3],:,259, Goodman married Hammond's sister, Alice Frances Hammond Duckworth (1913–1978), on March 20, 1942.,[42], They had two daughters and raised Alice's three daughters from her first marriage,[41], to British politician ,Arthur Duckworth,. Goodman's daughter Rachel became a classical pianist.,[43], She sometimes performed in concert with him, beginning when she was sixteen.,[44],
,Goodman and Hammond had disagreements from the 1930s onwards. For the 1939 Spirituals to Swing concert Hammond had placed Charlie Christian into the Kansas City Six to play before Goodman's band, which had angered Goodman. They disagreed over the band's music until Goodman refused to listen to Hammond. Their arguments escalated, and in 1941 Hammond left Columbia.,[3],:,311, Goodman appeared on a 1975 PBS tribute to Hammond but remained at a distance. In the 1980s, after the death of Alice Goodman, Hammond and Goodman reconciled. On June 25, 1985, Goodman appeared at ,Avery Fisher Hall, in New York City for ""A Tribute to John Hammond"".,[45],
,Goodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others as an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of ""The Ray"",,[3],:,173, the glare that Goodman directed at a musician who failed to perform to his standards. After guitarist ,Allan Reuss, incurred Goodman's displeasure, Goodman relegated him to the rear of the bandstand where his contribution would be drowned out by the other musicians. Vocalists ,Anita O'Day, and ,Helen Forrest, spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman: ""The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,"" said Forrest. ""When I look back, they seem like a life sentence."" He was generous and funded several college educations, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why, he said, ""Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out."",[3],:,296, 301, 302, 401,

,""As far as I'm concerned, what he did in those days—and they were hard days, in 1937—made it possible for Negroes to have their chance in baseball and other fields."",
,—Lionel Hampton on Benny Goodman,[3],:,183–184,
,
,
,Goodman helped racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by Jim Crow laws. Goodman hired Teddy Wilson for his trio and added vibraphonist Lionel Hampton for his quartet. In 1939 he hired guitarist Charlie Christian.,[,citation needed,], This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. ""Goodman's popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws."",[,This quote needs a citation,], According to ,Jazz, by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he ""played with that ,nigger,"" (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, ""I'll knock you out if you use that word around me again"".,[,This quote needs a citation,],
,In 1962, the Benny Goodman Orchestra toured the Soviet Union as part of a cultural exchange program between the two nations after the ,Cuban missile crisis, and the end of ,that phase of the Cold War,; both visits were part of efforts to normalize relations between the United States and the USSR.,[46], The ,Bolshoi Ballet, came to the United States, and the Benny Goodman Orchestra toured the USSR.  Members of the band included ,Jimmy Knepper,, Jerry Dodgion, and Turk Van Lake (Vanig Hovsepian).,[47], Bassist ,Bill Crow, published a very jaundiced view of the tour and Goodman's conduct during it under the title ""To Russia Without Love"".,[48],
,On June 25, 2019, ,The New York Times Magazine, listed Benny Goodman among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the ,2008 Universal fire,.,[49],

,
,
,^, ,Collier, in his book ,Benny Goodman and the Swing Era, (page 164), listed both a ""McFadden's Ballroom in San Francisco"" and ""Sweet's in Oakland"" as separate engagements for Goodman, with Pismo Beach in between. However, there was never a McFadden's or a Sweet's Ballroom in San Francisco, and the trip from there to Pismo Beach was inconveniently long. Oakland and San Francisco are about 15 miles (24 km) apart, but Pismo Beach is more than 235 miles (378 km) south of both of them. Pismo Beach is only 175 miles (282 km) from Los Angeles and would have been a more convenient place for Goodman to have played while traveling from Oakland to L.A.,

,Eleanora Fagan, (April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959), professionally known as ,Billie Holiday,, was an American ,jazz, singer with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed "",Lady Day,"" by her friend and music partner ,Lester Young,, Holiday had an innovative influence on jazz music and ,pop, singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating ,phrasing, and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.,[1],
,After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in ,Harlem,, where she was heard by the producer ,John Hammond,, who commended her voice. She signed a recording contract with ,Brunswick, in 1935. Collaborations with ,Teddy Wilson, yielded the hit "",What a Little Moonlight Can Do,"", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as ,Columbia, and ,Decca,. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at ,Carnegie Hall,, but her reputation deteriorated because of her drug and alcohol problems.
,She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Due to personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, ,Lady in Satin,, was released in 1958. Holiday died of ,cirrhosis, on July 17, 1959.
,She won four ,Grammy Awards,, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the ,Grammy Hall of Fame, in 1973. ,Lady Sings the Blues,, a film about her life, starring ,Diana Ross,, was released in 1972. She is the primary character in the play (later made into a film) ,Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,; the role was originated by Reenie Upchurch in 1986, and was played by ,Audra McDonald, on Broadway and in the film. In 2017 Holiday was inducted into the ,National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame,.

,Life and career,[,edit,],
,1915–29: Childhood,[,edit,],
,Eleanora Fagan,[2],[3], was born on April 7, 1915,,[4], in Philadelphia, the daughter of unwed teenage couple Sarah Julia ""Sadie"" Fagan and ,Clarence Holiday,. Sarah moved to Philadelphia aged 19,,[5], after she was evicted from her parents' home in the ,Sandtown-Winchester, neighborhood of ,Baltimore,, Maryland, for becoming pregnant. With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Eleanora to stay with her in Baltimore. Not long after Eleanora was born, Clarence abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist.,[6],
,
,  ,Holiday aged 2 in 1917,
,She grew up in Baltimore and had a very difficult childhood.  Her mother often took what were then known as ""transportation jobs,"" serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being in others' care for her first decade of life.,[7], Holiday's autobiography, ,Lady Sings the Blues,, first published in 1956, is sketchy on details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer.
,Some historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as ""Frank DeViese."" Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.,[8], DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie Harris may have known him through her work. Sadie Harris, then known as Sadie Fagan, married Philip Gough, but the marriage ended in two years.
,Eleanora was left with Martha Miller again while her mother took more transportation jobs.,[9], She frequently skipped school, and her ,truancy, resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court on January 5, 1925, when she was nine years old. She was sent to the House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic ,reform school,, where she was baptized on March 19, 1925. After nine months in care, she was ""paroled"" on October 3, 1925, to her mother. She had opened a restaurant, the East Side Grill, and mother and daughter worked long hours there. She dropped out of school at age 11.,[10],
,On December 24, 1926, Sadie came home to discover a neighbor, Wilbur Rich, attempting to rape Eleanora. She successfully fought back, and Rich was arrested. Officials placed Eleanora in the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case.,[11], Holiday was released in February 1927, when she was nearly twelve. She found a job running errands in a brothel,,[12], and she scrubbed ,marble steps, and kitchen and bathroom floors of neighborhood homes.,[13], Around this time, she first heard the records of ,Louis Armstrong, and ,Bessie Smith,. By the end of 1928, Holiday's mother moved to ,Harlem,, New York, again leaving Eleanora with Martha Miller.,[14],
,By early 1929, Holiday had joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply-dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. Holiday's mother became a prostitute, and within a matter of days of arriving in New York, Holiday, not yet 14, became a victim of sexual trafficking at $5 a client.,[15], The house was raided on May 2, 1929, and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending time in a ,workhouse,, her mother was released in July, and Holiday was released in October.
,
,1929–35: Early career,[,edit,],
,As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from ,Billie Dove,, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father.,[16], At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name ""Halliday,"" her father's birth surname, but eventually changed it to ""Holiday,"" his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, ,tenor saxophone, player Kenneth Hollan. They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, ,Pod's and Jerry's, on ,133rd Street,, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club.,[17],[18], ,Benny Goodman, recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the ,Alhambra, Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with ,Chick Webb,. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in ,Fletcher Henderson,'s band.,[19],
,Late in 1932, 17-year-old Holiday replaced the singer ,Monette Moore, at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. Producer ,John Hammond,, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933.,[20], Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: ""Your Mother's Son-in-Law"" and ""Riffin' the Scotch,"" the latter being her first hit. ""Son-in-Law"" sold 300 copies, but ""Riffin' the Scotch,"" released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, ""Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius."" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.,[21],
,In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in ,Duke Ellington,'s ,musical short, film ,Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life,. She sang ""Saddest Tale"" in her scene.,[22],
,
,1935–38: Recordings with Teddy Wilson,[,edit,],
,In 1935, Holiday was signed to ,Brunswick, by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist ,Teddy Wilson, in the ,swing, style for the growing ,jukebox, trade. They were allowed to ,improvise, the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included "",What a Little Moonlight Can Do,"" and "",Miss Brown to You,"". ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"" has been deemed her ""claim to fame"".,[23], Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like ,Cleo Brown,. However, after ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"" was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right.,[24], She began recording under her own name a year later for ,Vocalion, in sessions produced by Hammond and ,Bernie Hanighen,.,[25], Wilson and Holiday took pop tunes such as ""Twenty-Four Hours a Day"" and ""Yankee Doodle Never Went to Town"" and turned them into jazz classics.,[,citation needed,],
,Another frequent accompanist was tenor saxophonist ,Lester Young,, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a rapport. Young said, ""I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices ... or the same mind, or something like that."",[26], Young nicknamed her ""Lady Day"", and she called him ""Prez"".
,Hammond said the Wilson-Holiday records from 1935 to 1938 were a great asset to Brunswick. According to Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost. Brunswick paid Holiday a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved the company money. "",I Cried for You,"" sold 15,000 copies, which Hammond called ""a giant hit for Brunswick.... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand."",[27],
,
,1937–38: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw,[,edit,],
,In late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with ,Count Basie,.,[28], The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; they performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. Her tunes included ""I Must Have That Man"", ""Travelin' All Alone"", "",I Can't Get Started,"", and "",Summertime,"", a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in ,George Gershwin,'s ,Porgy and Bess, the year before. Basie became used to Holiday's heavy involvement in the band. He said, ""When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn't tell her what to do."",[29],
,Holiday found herself in direct competition with the popular singer ,Ella Fitzgerald,. The two later became friends.,[30], Fitzgerald was the vocalist for the ,Chick Webb, Band, which was in competition with the Basie band. On January 16, 1938, the same day that ,Benny Goodman, performed ,his legendary Carnegie Hall jazz concert,, the Basie and Webb bands had a battle at the ,Savoy Ballroom,. Webb and Fitzgerald were declared winners by ,Metronome, magazine, while ,DownBeat, magazine pronounced Holiday and Basie the winners. Fitzgerald won a straw poll of the audience by a three-to-one margin.
,Some of the songs Holiday performed with Basie were recorded. ""I Can't Get Started"", "",They Can't Take That Away from Me,"", and ""Swing It Brother Swing"" are all commercially available.,[31], Holiday was unable to record in the studio with Basie, but she included many of his musicians in her recording sessions with Teddy Wilson.
,By February of that year, Holiday was no longer singing for Basie. Various reasons have been given for her firing. ,Jimmy Rushing,, Basie's male vocalist, called her unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, Holiday was fired for being ""temperamental and unreliable"". She complained of low pay and poor working conditions and may have refused to sing the songs requested of her or change her style.,[32],
,Holiday was hired by ,Artie Shaw, a month after being fired from the Count Basie Band. This association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an unusual arrangement at that time. This was also the first time a black female singer employed full-time toured the ,segregated, U.S. South with a white bandleader. In situations where there was a lot of racial tension, Shaw was known to stick up for his vocalist. In her autobiography, Holiday describes an incident in which she was not permitted to sit on the bandstand with other vocalists because she was black. Shaw said to her, ""I want you on the band stand like ,Helen Forrest,, ,Tony Pastor, and everyone else."",[33], When touring the South, Holiday would sometimes be heckled by members of the audience. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man called her a ""nigger wench"" and requested she sing another song. Holiday lost her temper and had to be escorted off the stage.,[34],
,By March 1938, Shaw and Holiday had been broadcast on New York City's powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now ,WCBS,). Because of their success, they were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased their exposure. The ,New York Amsterdam News, reviewed the broadcasts and reported an improvement in Holiday's performance. ,Metronome, reported that the addition of Holiday to Shaw's band put it in the ""top brackets"". Holiday could not sing as often during Shaw's shows as she could in Basie's; the repertoire was more instrumental, with fewer vocals. Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom Holiday did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Shaw won band battles against ,Tommy Dorsey, and ,Red Norvo, with the audience favoring Holiday. Although Shaw admired Holiday's singing in his band, saying she had a ""remarkable ear"" and a ""remarkable sense of time"", her tenure with the band was nearing an end.,[35],
,In November 1938, Holiday was asked to use the service elevator at the ,Lincoln Hotel,, instead of the passenger elevator, because white patrons of the hotels complained. This may have been the last straw for her. She left the band shortly after. Holiday spoke about the incident weeks later, saying, ""I was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] I was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.""
,There are no surviving live recordings of Holiday with Shaw's band. Because she was under contract to a different record label and possibly because of her race, Holiday was able to make only one record with Shaw, ""Any Old Time"". However, Shaw played clarinet on four songs she recorded in New York on July 10, 1936: ""Did I Remember?"", ""No Regrets"", ""Summertime"" and "",Billie's Blues,"".
,By the late 1930s, Holiday had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. Her songs "",What a Little Moonlight Can Do,"" and "",Easy Living,"" were imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming ,jazz standards,.,[36], In 1938, Holiday's single ""I'm Gonna Lock My Heart"" ranked sixth as the most-played song in September of that year. Her record label, Vocalion, listed the single as its fourth-best seller for the same month, and it peaked at number 2 on the pop charts, according to Joel Whitburn's ,Pop Memories: 1890–1954,.,[37],
,
,1939: ""Strange Fruit"" and Commodore Records,[,edit,],
,Holiday was recording for ,Columbia, in the late 1930s when she was introduced to "",Strange Fruit,"", a song based on a poem about ,lynching, written by ,Abel Meeropol,, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym ""Lewis Allan"" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings.,[38], It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, the proprietor of ,Café Society,, an integrated nightclub in ,Greenwich Village,, who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939,,[39], with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. She later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.
,For her performance of ""Strange Fruit"" at the Café Society, she had waiters silence the crowd when the song began. During the song's long introduction, the lights dimmed and all movement had to cease. As Holiday began singing, only a small spotlight illuminated her face. On the final note, all lights went out, and when they came back on, Holiday was gone.,[40],
,Holiday said her father, Clarence Holiday, was denied medical treatment for a fatal lung disorder because of racial prejudice, and that singing ""Strange Fruit"" reminded her of the incident. ""It reminds me of how Pop died, but I have to keep singing it, not only because people ask for it, but because twenty years after Pop died the things that killed him are still happening in the South"", she wrote in her autobiography.,[41],
,When Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, ,Milt Gabler, agreed to record it for his ,Commodore Records, label on April 20, 1939. ""Strange Fruit"" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She recorded it again for ,Verve,. The Commodore release did not get any airplay, but the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, "",Fine and Mellow,"", which was a ,jukebox, hit.,[42], ""The version I recorded for Commodore"", Holiday said of ""Strange Fruit"", ""became my biggest-selling record."",[43], ""Strange Fruit"" was the equivalent of a top-twenty hit in the 1930s.
,Holiday's popularity increased after ""Strange Fruit"". She received a mention in ,Time, magazine.,[44], ""I open Café Society as an unknown,"" Holiday said. ""I left two years later as a star. I needed the prestige and publicity all right, but you can't pay rent with it."" She soon demanded a raise from her manager, ,Joe Glaser,.,[45],
,Holiday returned to Commodore in 1944, recording songs she made with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s, including "",I Cover the Waterfront,"", "",I'll Get By,"", and ""He's Funny That Way"". She also recorded new songs that were popular at the time, including, "",My Old Flame,"", ""How Am I to Know?"", ""I'm Yours"", and "",I'll Be Seeing You,"", a number one hit for ,Bing Crosby,. She also recorded her version of "",Embraceable You,"", which was inducted into the ,Grammy Hall of Fame, in 2005.

,1940–47: Commercial success,[,edit,],
,  ,""Portrait of Billie Holiday and Mister, Downbeat, New York, N.Y., ca. Feb. 1947"",
,Holiday's mother Sadie, nicknamed ""The Duchess"", opened a restaurant called Mom Holiday's. She used money from her daughter while playing dice with members of the Count Basie band, with whom she toured in the late 1930s. ""It kept Mom busy and happy and stopped her from worrying and watching over me"", Holiday said. Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant. Holiday obliged but soon fell on hard times herself. ""I needed some money one night and I knew Mom was sure to have some"", she said. ""So I walked in the restaurant like a stockholder and asked. Mom turned me down flat. She wouldn't give me a cent."" The two argued, and Holiday shouted angrily, ""God bless the child that's got his own"", and stormed out. With ,Arthur Herzog, Jr.,, a pianist, she wrote a song based on the lyric, "",God Bless the Child,"", and added music.,[46],
,""God Bless the Child"" became Holiday's most popular and most covered record. It reached number 25 on the charts in 1941 and was third in ,Billboard,',s songs of the year, selling over a million records.,[47],[48], In 1976, the song was added to the ,Grammy Hall of Fame,.,[49], Herzog claimed Holiday contributed only a few lines to the lyrics. He said she came up with the line ""God bless the child"" from a dinner conversation the two had had.,[50],
,On June 24, 1942, Holiday recorded "",Trav'lin Light,"" with ,Paul Whiteman, for a new label, ,Capitol Records,. Because she was under contract to Columbia, she used the pseudonym ""Lady Day"".,[51], The song reached number 23 on the pop charts and number one on the ,R&B charts,, then called the Harlem Hit Parade.,[52],
,In September 1943, ,Life, magazine wrote, ""She has the most distinct style of any popular vocalist and is imitated by other vocalists."",[53],
,Milt Gabler,, in addition to owning Commodore Records, became an ,A&R, man for ,Decca Records,. He signed Holiday to Decca on August 7, 1944, when she was 29.,[54], Her first Decca recording was "",Lover Man,"" (number 16 Pop, number 5 R&B), one of her biggest hits. The success and distribution of the song made Holiday a staple in the pop community, leading to solo concerts, rare for jazz singers in the late 40s. Gabler said, ""I made Billie a real pop singer. That was right in her. Billie loved those songs."",[55], Jimmy Davis and ,Roger ""Ram"" Ramirez,, the song's writers, had tried to interest Holiday in the song.,[56], In 1943, a flamboyant male torch singer, Willie Dukes, began singing ""Lover Man"" on ,52nd Street,.,[57], Because of his success, Holiday added it to her shows. The record's flip side was "",No More,"", one of her favorites.,[54],
,Holiday asked Gabler for ,strings, on the recording. Such arrangements were associated with ,Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. ""I went on my knees to him,"" Holiday said. ""I didn't want to do it with the ordinary six pieces. I begged Milt and told him I had to have strings behind me."",[58], On October 4, 1944, Holiday entered the studio to record ""Lover Man"", saw the string ensemble and walked out. The musical director, ,Toots Camarata,, said Holiday was overwhelmed with joy.,[58], She may also have wanted strings to avoid comparisons between her commercially successful early work with Teddy Wilson and everything produced afterwards. Her 1930s recordings with Wilson used a small jazz combo; recordings for Decca often involved strings.,[58],
,A month later, in November, Holiday returned to Decca to record "",That Ole Devil Called Love,"", ""Big Stuff"", and "",Don't Explain,"". She wrote ""Don't Explain"" after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar.,[59],
,Holiday did not make any more records until August 1945, when she recorded ""Don't Explain"" for a second time, changing the lyrics ""I know you raise Cain"" to ""Just say you'll remain"" and changing ""You mixed with some dame"" to ""What is there to gain?"" Other songs recorded were ""Big Stuff"", "",What Is This Thing Called Love?,"", and ""You Better Go Now"". Ella Fitzgerald named ""You Better Go Now"" her favorite recording of Holiday's.,[60], ""Big Stuff"" and ""Don't Explain"" were recorded again but with additional strings and a ,viola,.
,
,  ,Holiday and her dog Mister, New York, ,c., June 1946,
,In 1946, Holiday recorded "",Good Morning Heartache,"". Although the song failed to chart, she sang it in live performances; three live recordings are known.,[61],
,In September 1946, Holiday began her only major film, ,New Orleans,, in which she starred opposite ,Louis Armstrong, and ,Woody Herman,. Plagued by racism and ,McCarthyism,, producer ,Jules Levey, and script writer ,Herbert Biberman, were pressed to lessen Holiday's and Armstrong's roles to avoid the impression that black people created jazz. The attempts failed because in 1947 Biberman was listed as one of the ,Hollywood Ten, and sent to jail.,[62],
,Several scenes were deleted from the film. ""They had taken miles of footage of music and scenes,"" Holiday said, but ""none of it was left in the picture. And very damn little of me. I know I wore a white dress for a number I did... and that was cut out of the picture."",[63], She recorded ""The Blues Are Brewin'"" for the film's soundtrack. Other songs included in the movie are "",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,"" and ""Farewell to Storyville"".
,Holiday's drug addictions were a problem on the set. She earned more than a thousand dollars a week from club ventures but spent most of it on ,heroin,. Her lover, ,Joe Guy,, traveled to Hollywood while Holiday was filming and supplied her with drugs. Guy was banned from the set when he was found there by Holiday's manager, Joe Glaser.,[64],
,By the late 1940s, Holiday had begun recording a number of slow, sentimental ballads. ,Metronome, expressed its concerns in 1946 about ""Good Morning Heartache"", saying, ""there's a danger that Billie's present formula will wear thin, but up to now it's wearing well."",[40], The ,New York Herald Tribune, reported of a concert in 1946 that her performance had little variation in melody and no change in tempo.,[65],
,
,1947–52: Legal troubles and Carnegie Hall concert,[,edit,],
,  ,Holiday at the Club Bali, Washington, with Al Dunn (drums), and Bobby Tucker (piano),
,By 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made $250,000 in the three previous years.,[66], She was ranked second in the ,DownBeat, poll for 1946 and 1947, her highest ranking in that poll.,[67], She was ranked fifth in ,Billboard, 's annual college poll of ""girl singers"" on July 6, 1947 (,Jo Stafford, was first). In 1946, Holiday won the ,Metronome, magazine popularity poll.,[68],
,On May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for possession of ,narcotics, in her New York apartment. On May 27 she was in court. ""It was called 'The United States of America versus Billie Holiday'. And that's just the way it felt,"" she recalled.,[69], During the trial, she heard that her lawyer would not come to the trial to represent her. ""In plain English that meant no one in the world was interested in looking out for me,"" she said. Dehydrated and unable to hold down food, she pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to the hospital. The district attorney spoke in her defense, saying, ""If your honor please, this is a case of a drug addict, but more serious, however, than most of our cases, Miss Holiday is a professional entertainer and among the higher rank as far as income was concerned."" She was sentenced to ,Alderson Federal Prison Camp, in West Virginia. The drug possession conviction caused her to lose her ,New York City Cabaret Card,; thereafter, she performed in concert venues and theaters.,[70],
,
,  ,Holiday at the ,Downbeat Jazz Club,, New York,,[71], ,c. February 1947,
,Holiday was released early (on March 16, 1948), because of good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, her pianist ,Bobby Tucker, and her dog Mister were waiting. The dog leaped at Holiday, knocking off her hat, and tackling her to the ground. ""He began lapping me and loving me like crazy,"" she said. A woman thought the dog was attacking Holiday. She screamed, a crowd gathered, and reporters arrived. ""I might just as well have wheeled into Penn Station and had a quiet little get-together with the ,Associated Press,, ,United Press,, and ,International News Service,,"" she said.,[72],
,Ed Fishman (who fought with Joe Glaser to be Holiday's manager) thought of a comeback concert at ,Carnegie Hall,. Holiday hesitated, unsure audiences would accept her after the arrest. She gave in and agreed to appear.
,On March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd. 2,700 tickets were sold in advance, a record at the time for the venue. Her popularity was unusual because she didn't have a current hit record.,[73], Her last record to reach the charts was ""Lover Man"" in 1945. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including ,Cole Porter,'s "",Night and Day,"" and her 1930s hit, "",Strange Fruit,"". During the show, someone sent her a box of gardenias. ""My old trademark,"" Holiday said. ""I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice."" There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday unknowingly stuck it into the side of her head. ""I didn't feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears,"" she said. After the third curtain call, she passed out.,[74],
,On April 27, 1948, Bob Sylvester and her promoter Al Wilde arranged a Broadway show for her. Titled ,Holiday on Broadway,, it sold out. ""The regular music critics and drama critics came and treated us like we were legit,"" she said. But it closed after three weeks.,[75],
,Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949 in her room at the Hotel Mark Twain in San Francisco.,[76],
,
,  ,Holiday in court over a contract dispute, late 1949,
,Holiday said she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy.
,In October 1949, Holiday recorded "",Crazy He Calls Me,"", which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after ""Lover Man"". The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.,[77],
,Holiday's ,New York City Cabaret Card, was revoked because of her 1947 conviction, preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol for the remaining 12 years of her life.
,The cabaret system started in 1940 and was intended to prevent people of ""bad character"" from working on licensed premises. A performer had to renew the license every two years. The system lasted until 1967.,[78], Clubs that sold alcohol in New York were among the highest-paying in the country. Club owners knew ,blacklisted, performers had limited work and could offer a smaller salary. This reduced Holiday's earnings. She had not received proper record royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday's records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. In 1958 she received a royalty of only $11.,[79],[80], Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, registered with BMI only two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.,[81],
,In 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which, because she lost her cabaret card, was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. ""I opened scared,"" Holiday said, ""[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off. But nothing happened. I was a huge success."",[82],
,Holiday recorded Gershwin's "",I Loves You, Porgy,"" in 1948.
,In 1950, Holiday appeared in the ,Universal, short film ,Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet,, singing ""God Bless the Child"" and ""Now, Baby or Never"".,[83],
,
,1952–59: ,Lady Sings the Blues,[,edit,],
,By the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. She appeared on the ,ABC, ,reality series, ,The Comeback Story, to discuss attempts to overcome her misfortunes. Her later recordings showed the effects of declining health on her voice, as it grew coarse and no longer projected its former vibrancy,[,dubious, , – ,discuss,],.
,Holiday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a ,Leonard Feather, package. The ,Swedish, ,impresario,, ,Nils Hellstrom,, initiated the ""Jazz Club U.S.A."" (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in ,Stockholm, in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, ,Buddy DeFranco,, ,Red Norvo,, ,Carl Drinkard,, ,Elaine Leighton,, ,Sonny Clark,, ,Berryl Booker,, ,Jimmy Raney,, and ,Red Mitchell,. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as ,Lady Love – Billie Holiday,.,[84],
,Holiday's late recordings for Verve constitute about a third of her commercially issued output and are as popular as her earlier records for Columbia, Commodore and Decca. In later years, her voice became more fragile, but it never lost the edge that had always made it distinctive.
,Holiday's autobiography, ,Lady Sings the Blues,, was ghostwritten by ,William Dufty, and published in 1956. Dufty, a ,New York Post, writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment. He also drew on the work of earlier interviewers and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way.,[85],
,In his 2015 study, ,Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth,, ,John Szwed, argued that ,Lady Sings the Blues, is a generally accurate account of her life, and that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. According to the reviewer ,Richard Brody,, ""Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with ,Charles Laughton,, in the 1930s, and with ,Tallulah Bankhead,, in the late 1940s—and of one relationship that's sharply diminished in the book, her affair with ,Orson Welles, around the time of ,Citizen Kane,."",[86],
,To accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP ,Lady Sings the Blues, in June 1956. The album featured four new tracks, "",Lady Sings the Blues,"", "",Too Marvelous for Words,"", "",Willow Weep for Me,"", and "",I Thought About You,"", and eight new recordings of her biggest hits to date. The re-recordings included "",Trav'lin' Light,"" "",Strange Fruit,"" and "",God Bless the Child,"".,[87], A review of the album was published by ,Billboard, magazine on December 22, 1956, calling it a worthy musical complement to her autobiography. ""Holiday is in good voice now,"" wrote the reviewer, ""and these new readings will be much appreciated by her following."" ""Strange Fruit"" and ""God Bless the Child"" were called classics, and ""Good Morning Heartache"", another reissued track on the LP, was also noted favorably.,[88],
,On November 10, 1956, Holiday performed two concerts before packed audiences at ,Carnegie Hall,. Live recordings of the second Carnegie Hall concert were released on a Verve/HMV album in the UK in late 1961 called ,The Essential Billie Holiday,. The 13 tracks included on this album featured her own songs "",I Love My Man,"", "",Don't Explain,"" and "",Fine and Mellow,"", together with other songs closely associated with her, including "",Body and Soul,"", "",My Man,"", and ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (her lyrics accompanied a tune by pianist ,Herbie Nichols,).,[89],
,The liner notes for this album were written partly by Gilbert Millstein of the ,New York Times,, who, according to these notes, served as narrator of the Carnegie Hall concerts. Interspersed among Holiday's songs, Millstein read aloud four lengthy passages from her autobiography, ,Lady Sings the Blues,. He later wrote:
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},The narration began with the ironic account of her birth in Baltimore – 'Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen, and I was three' – and ended, very nearly shyly, with her hope for love and a long life with 'my man' at her side. It was evident, even then, that Miss Holiday was ill. I had known her casually over the years and I was shocked at her physical weakness. Her rehearsal had been desultory; her voice sounded tinny and trailed off; her body sagged tiredly. But I will not forget the metamorphosis that night. The lights went down, the musicians began to play and the narration began. Miss Holiday stepped from between the curtains, into the white spotlight awaiting her, wearing a white evening gown and white gardenias in her black hair. She was erect and beautiful; poised and smiling. And when the first section of narration was ended, she sang – with strength undiminished – with all of the art that was hers. I was very much moved. In the darkness, my face burned and my eyes. I recall only one thing. I smiled."",[90],
,The critic ,Nat Hentoff, of ,DownBeat, magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday's performance:
,
,Throughout the night, Billie was in superior form to what had sometimes been the case in the last years of her life. Not only was there assurance of phrasing and intonation; but there was also an outgoing warmth, a palpable eagerness to reach and touch the audience. And there was mocking wit. A smile was often lightly evident on her lips and her eyes as if, for once, she could accept the fact that there were people who did dig her. The beat flowed in her uniquely sinuous, supple way of moving the story along; the words became her own experiences; and coursing through it all was Lady's sound – a texture simultaneously steel-edged and yet soft inside; a voice that was almost unbearably wise in disillusion and yet still childlike, again at the centre. The audience was hers from before she sang, greeting her and saying good-bye with heavy, loving applause. And at one time, the musicians too applauded. It was a night when Billie was on top, undeniably the best and most honest jazz singer alive.,
,Her performance of ""Fine and Mellow"" on ,CBS,'s ,The Sound of Jazz, program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend ,Lester Young,. Both were less than two years from death. Young died in March 1959. Holiday wanted to sing at his funeral, but her request was denied.
,When Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later, in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's ,Chelsea at Nine, in London. Her final studio recordings were made for ,MGM Records, in 1959, with lush backing from ,Ray Ellis, and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on the Columbia album ,Lady in Satin, the previous year (see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later retitled and re-released as ,Last Recording,.
,On March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a ,Mafia, enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive.,[91], They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, on the model of the ,Arthur Murray, dance schools.
,Holiday was childless, but she had two godchildren: singer ,Billie Lorraine Feather, (the daughter of Leonard Feather) and ,Bevan Dufty, (the son of ,William Dufty,).,[85],
,
,Death and legacy,[,edit,],
,By early 1959, Holiday was diagnosed with ,cirrhosis,. Although she had initially stopped drinking on her doctor's orders, it was not long before she relapsed.,[92], By May of that same year, she had lost 20 pounds (9 kg). Her manager ,Joe Glaser,, jazz critic ,Leonard Feather,, photojournalist Allan Morrison, and the singer's own friends all tried in vain to persuade her to go to a hospital.,[93],
,On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to ,Metropolitan Hospital, in New York for treatment of ,liver disease, and ,heart disease,. The ,Federal Bureau of Narcotics,, under the order of ,Harry J. Anslinger,, had been targeting Holiday since at least 1939.,[94], She was arrested and handcuffed for drug possession as she lay dying, her hospital room was raided, and she was placed under police guard.,[94], On July 15, she received the last rites of the Roman ,Catholic Church,.,[95], She died at 3:10 a.m. on July 17, of ,pulmonary edema, and ,heart failure, caused by cirrhosis of the liver.,[96],[97], She was 44. In her final years, she had been progressively swindled out,[,by whom?,], of her earnings, and she died with US$0.70 in the bank. Her funeral Mass was held on July 21, 1959, at the ,Church of St. Paul the Apostle, in Manhattan. She was buried at ,Saint Raymond's Cemetery, in the Bronx. The story of her burial plot,[98], and how it was managed by her estranged husband, Louis McKay, was documented on ,NPR, in 2012.,[99],
,Gilbert Millstein of ,New York Times,, who was the announcer at Holiday's 1956 Carnegie Hall concerts and wrote parts of the sleeve notes for the album ,The Essential Billie Holiday, (see above), described her death in these sleeve notes, dated 1961:
,
,Billie Holiday died in Metropolitan Hospital, New York, on Friday, July 17, 1959, in the bed in which she had been arrested for illegal possession of narcotics a little more than a month before, as she lay mortally ill; in the room from which a police guard had been removed – by court order – only a few hours before her death, which, like her life, was disorderly and pitiful. She had been strikingly beautiful, but she was wasted physically to a small, grotesque caricature of herself. The worms of every kind of excess – drugs were only one – had eaten her. The likelihood exists that among the last thoughts of this cynical, sentimental, profane, generous and greatly talented woman of 44 was the belief that she was to be arraigned the following morning. She would have been, eventually, although possibly not that quickly. In any case, she removed herself finally from the jurisdiction of any court here below.,[90],
,Vocal style and range,[,edit,],
,Holiday's delivery made her performances recognizable throughout her career. Her improvisation compensated for lack of musical education. Her ,contralto, voice,[100], lacked range and was thin,[,dubious, , – ,discuss,],, and years of drug use altered its texture and gave it a fragile, raspy sound. Holiday said that she always wanted her voice to sound like an instrument and some of her influences were ,Louis Armstrong, and the singer ,Bessie Smith,.,[101],[,full citation needed,], Her last major recording, a 1958 album entitled ,Lady in Satin,, features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by ,Ray Ellis,, who said of the album in 1997:
,
,I would say that the most emotional moment was her listening to the playback of ""I'm a Fool to Want You."" There were tears in her eyes ... After we finished the album I went into the control room and listened to all the takes. I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was just listening musically instead of emotionally. It wasn't until I heard the final mix a few weeks later that I realized how great her performance really was.,[102],
,Frank Sinatra, was influenced by her performances on 52nd Street as a young man. He told ,Ebony, magazine in 1958 about her impact:
,
, With few exceptions, every major pop singer in the US during her generation has been touched in some way by her genius. It is Billie Holiday who was, and still remains, the greatest single musical influence on me. Lady Day is unquestionably the most important influence on American popular singing in the last twenty years.,[103],
,Discography,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Billie Holiday discography,
,Billie Holiday recorded extensively for four labels: ,Columbia Records,, which issued her recordings on its subsidiary labels ,Brunswick Records,, ,Vocalion Records,, and ,OKeh Records,, from 1933 through 1942; ,Commodore Records, in 1939 and 1944; ,Decca Records, from 1944 through 1950; briefly for ,Aladdin Records, in 1951; ,Verve Records, and on its earlier imprint ,Clef Records, from 1952 through 1957, then again for ,Columbia Records, from 1957 to 1958 and finally for ,MGM Records, in 1959. Many of Holiday's recordings appeared on ,78-rpm records, prior to the ,long-playing vinyl record era,, and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued albums during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death; as well as comprehensive ,box sets, and live recordings.,[104],[105],
,
,Hit records,[,edit,],
,In 1986, ,Joel Whitburn,'s company Record Research compiled information on the popularity of recordings released from the era predating rock and roll and created pop charts dating back to the beginning of the commercial recording industry. The company's findings were published in the book ,Pop Memories 1890–1954,. Several of Holiday's records are listed on the pop charts Whitburn created.,[106],
,Holiday began her recording career on a high note with her first major release, ""Riffin' the Scotch"", of which 5,000 copies were sold. It was released under the name ""Benny Goodman & His Orchestra."",[106],
,Most of Holiday's early successes were released under the name ""Teddy Wilson & His Orchestra."" During her stay in Wilson's band, Holiday would sing a few bars and then other musicians would have a solo. Wilson, one of the most influential jazz pianists of the swing era,,[107], accompanied Holiday more than any other musician. He and Holiday issued 95 recordings together.,[108],
,In July 1936, Holiday began releasing sides under her own name. These songs were released under the band name ""Billie Holiday & Her Orchestra."",[109], Most noteworthy, the popular jazz standard "",Summertime,"" sold well and was listed on the pop charts of the time at number 12, the first time the jazz standard charted. Only ,Billy Stewart,'s R&B version of ""Summertime"" reached a higher chart placement than Holiday's, charting at number 10 thirty years later in 1966.,[110],
,Holiday had 16 best selling songs in 1937, making the year her most commercially successful. It was in this year that Holiday scored her sole number one hit as a featured vocalist on the available pop charts of the 1930s, ""Carelessly"". The hit "",I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,"", was also recorded by ,Ray Noble,, ,Glen Gray, and ,Fred Astaire, whose rendering was a best seller for weeks.,[111], Holiday's version ranked 6 on the year-end single chart available for 1937.,[47],
,In 1939, Holiday recorded her biggest selling record, "",Strange Fruit,"" for Commodore, charting at number 16 on the available pop charts for the 1930s.,[112],
,In 1940, ,Billboard, began publishing its modern pop charts, which included the ,Best Selling Retail Records, chart, the precursor to the Hot 100. None of Holiday's songs placed on the modern pop charts, partly because ,Billboard, only published the first ten slots of the charts in some issues. Minor hits and independent releases had no way of being spotlighted.
,"",God Bless the Child,"", which went on to sell over a million copies, ranked number 3 on ,Billboard,',s year-end top songs of 1941.,[48],
,On October 24, 1942, ,Billboard, began issuing its R&B charts. Two of Holiday's songs placed on the chart, "",Trav'lin' Light,"" with Paul Whiteman, which topped the chart, and "",Lover Man,"", which reached number 5. ""Trav'lin' Light"" also reached 18 on ,Billboard,',s year-end chart.

,Main article: ,List of awards and nominations received by Billie Holiday,
,When Holiday died, ,The New York Times, published a short obituary on page 15 without a byline. She left an estate of $1,000 and her best recordings from the '30s were mostly out of print. Holiday's public stature grew in the following years. In 1961 she was voted to the Down Beat Hall Of Fame and soon after Columbia reissued nearly a hundred of her early records. In 1972 Diana Ross' portrayal of Holiday in ,Lady Sings The Blues, was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Holiday would go on to be nominated for 23 posthumous Grammy awards.,[113],
,Billie Holiday received several Esquire Magazine awards during her lifetime. Her posthumous awards also include being inducted into the ,Grammy Hall of Fame,, Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame, ,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,, and the ,ASCAP, Jazz Wall of Fame. In 1985 Baltimore, Maryland erected a statue of Billie Holiday that was completed in 1993 with additional panels of images inspired by her seminal song ,Strange Fruit.,[114], In 2019, ,Chirlane McCray, announced that New York City would build a statue honoring Holiday near ,Queens Borough Hall,.,[115],
,On June 25, 2019, ,The New York Times Magazine, listed Billie Holiday among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the ,2008 Universal fire,.,[116],

Some examples of emoji are 😃, 😭, and 😈. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. They are much like ,emoticons,, but emoji are pictures rather than ,typographic approximations,; the term ""emoji"" in the strict sense refers to such pictures which can be represented as ,encoded characters,, but it is sometimes applied to ,messaging stickers, by extension.,[2], Originally meaning ,pictograph,, the word ,emoji, comes from Japanese ,e, (,絵,, ""picture""), + ,moji, (,文字,, ""character""),; the resemblance to the English words ,emotion, and ,emoticon, is ,purely coincidental,.,[3], The ,ISO 15924, script code for emoji is ,Zsye,.

,Note,: These counts are for emoji that are single Unicode characters;,[10],[11], many more emoji are composed of sequences of two or more characters.,[12], Emoji were first defined in Unicode 6.0, and pre-6.0 characters were only defined as emoji in 6.0 or later.,
,The emoji was predated by the ,emoticon,,,[13], a basic text-based version of the now established ,Unicode, emoji language and likely took inspiration from ,pictograms,. Numerous attempts in the 1990s were made in ,Europe,, ,Japan,, and the ,United States, to enhance the basic ,emoticon, to make it more desirable for use.,[14],[15], The emoji is based on the premise of using text markers to form images. This dates back to the 1960s, when ,Russian, novelist and professor ,Vladimir Nabokov, stated in an interview with ,The New York Times, ,""I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile — some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket."",[16], However, it wasn't until the 1980s when computer scientist ,Scott Fahlman, invented the ,emoticon,, by suggesting that :-) and :-( could replace language.,[17],
,In the early 1990s, there were a number of digital ,smileys, and ,emoticons, that were used in fonts, ,pictograms,, graphical representations, and even welcome messages. The font ,Wingdings,, designed and used on ,Microsoft, platforms, used ,smiley, and sad faces in its language and first appeared on ,Windows, and other ,Microsoft, platforms from 1990 onwards. In late 1995, it was announced in the French newspaper, ,Le Monde,, that telecoms company ,Alcatel, would be launching a mobile phone to be released in 1996. The newspaper article displays the BC 600, with the welcome screen displaying a digital ,smiley, face.,[18], Versions of the ,Nokia, phone also contained sets of graphics, which in 2001 they were still referring to as ,smileys,.,[,citation needed,],
,Numerous claims have been made to who invented the first emoji. Those making the claims drew inspiration from many sources, including ,pictograms, and symbols, ,smileys, and digital interpretations of language. Some of the precursors to the emoji can include theories by both ,Vladimir Nabokov, and ,Scott Fahlman,. One of the more notable claims was by ,Shigetaka Kurita, in 1999.,[19],[20], Kurita created a set of emojis while working on ,NTT DoCoMo,'s ,i-mode, ,Mobile web, platform.,[21], According to interviews, he took inspiration from weather pictograms, used to depict the weather conditions at any given time. He also drew inspiration from ,Chinese characters, and street sign ,pictograms,.,[21],[22],[23], Kurita's work is now displayed in the ,Museum of Modern Art, in ,New York City,.,[24],
,Emojipedia, released findings in early 2019 stating they believed a set of 90 emojis for the J-Phone, predated Kurita's design. Known as the ,SoftBank, emoji set, they predicted it dated back to 1997. The set was first released on ,Japan,'s J-Phone and is the first phone known to contain a set of emojis as part of its typeface. Many of the images would later be included in the ,Unicode Standard,, such as ,Pile of Poo,. The J-Phone didn't sell well due to its high retail price and therefore mass-market adoption didn't take place at the time.,[25], The first set of emojis by ,SoftBank, contained no color, unlike Kurita's which did use color. Both sets were made up of generic images that depicted, numbers, sports, the time, moon phases and the weather. Both Kurita and ,SoftBank,'s designs were 12 x 12 pixels emoji pictograms.,[26],
,Japan, was the first country to widely adopt the early emoji sets for use on ,mobile phones,. ,Japanese mobile operators, NTT DoCoMo, ,au,, and ,SoftBank Mobile, (formerly ,Vodafone,) all implemented emoji sets in the late 1990s to their phones. These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using proprietary standards. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.,[4], Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other things in the city.,[23], 
,Various, often incompatible, ,character encoding, schemes were developed by different mobile providers in Japan for their own emoji sets. When transmitted in ,Shift JIS, on NTT DoCoMo, emoji symbols are specified as a two-,byte, sequence in the range F89F through F9FC. The basic specification has 176 symbols, with 76 more added in phones that support ,C-HTML, 4.0.,[27], Emoji pictograms by Japanese mobile phone brand ,Au by KDDI, are specified using the ,IMG tag,,,[,citation needed,], encoded in Shift JIS between F340 and F7FC,,[28],[29], or encoded in extended ,JIS X 0208, between 7521 and 7B73.,[29], SoftBank Mobile emoji support colors and animation, and use different formats on 2G versus 3G:,[30], in the 2G format, they are encoded in sequences using the ,.mw-parser-output .control-code-link-internal{border-bottom:1px dashed #86a1ff}.mw-parser-output .control-code-link-internal a{color:inherit},Escape, and ,Shift In, control characters, whereas in the 3G format, they are encoded in Shift JIS between F741 and FBDE.,[28],[29], The SoftBank 3G format collides with the overlapping ranges used by the other vendors: for example, the Shift JIS representation F797 is used for a ,convenience store, (🏪) by SoftBank, but for a ,wristwatch, (⌚️) by KDDI.,[28],[29],
,DoCoMo,[29], and SoftBank,[31], also developed their own schemes for representing their emoji sets in extended JIS X 0208 between 7522 and 7E38. These often matched the encodings of similar KDDI emoji where they existed: for example, the camera (📷) was represented in Shift JIS as F8E2 by DoCoMo, F6EE by KDDI, and F948 by SoftBank, but as 7670 in JIS by all three.,[29],[31], All three vendors also developed schemes for encoding their emoji in the Unicode ,Private Use Area,: DoCoMo, for example, used the range U+E63E through U+E757.,[29],
,
,Development of emoji sets (2000–2009),
,The basic 12x12 pixel emoji in ,Japan, grew in popularity across various platforms over the next decade. This was aided by the introduction of ,i-mode,, which for many was the origins of the ,smartphone,. ,i-mode, also saw the introduction of emojis in conversation form on messenger ,apps,. By 2004, ,i-mode, had 40 million subscribers, meaning numerous people were exposed to the emoji for the first time between 2000 and 2004. The popularity of i-mode led to other manufacturers competing with similar offerings and therefore developed their own emoji sets. While emoji adoption was high in ,Japan, during this time, the companies failed to collaborate and come up with a uniform set of emojis to be used across all platforms in the country.,[32],
,The ,Universal Coded Character Set, (,Unicode,), overseen by the ,Unicode Consortium, and ,ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2,, had been established as the international standard for text representation (,ISO/IEC 10646,) since 1993, although variants of ,Shift JIS, remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from ,North American, or ,Western European, sources such as ,ITC Zapf Dingbats, or ,DOS code page 437,,,[33], but had not incorporated the Japanese cellular emoji characters. Unicode's coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets, although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0 release contained 16 new emojis, which included direction arrows, a warning triangle, and an eject button.,[34],
,Additionally, other ,dingbat, fonts such as ,Wingdings, or ,Webdings, included additional pictographic symbols in custom ,pi font, encodings. For example, a ,national park, pictogram (🏞) was available in Webdings at ,0x,50, corresponding to the capital letter ,P, in ,ASCII,. Unlike Zapf Dingbats, many of these would not be available as Unicode emoji until 2014.,[35],
,The Smiley Company, developed The Smiley Dictionary, which was launched in 2001. The desktop platform was aimed at allowing people to insert smileys as text when sending emails and writing on a ,desktop computer,.,[36], The smiley toolbar offered a variety of symbols and smileys and was used on platforms such as ,MSN Messenger,.,[37], ,Nokia, as one of the largest telecoms companies globally at the time, were still referring to today's emoji sets as ,smileys, in 2001.,[,citation needed,], The digital smiley movement was headed up by Nicolas Loufrani, the CEO of The Smiley Company.,[36], He created a smiley toolbar, which was  available at smileydictionary.com during the early 2000s to be sent as emojis are today.,[38],
,Mobile providers in both the ,United States, and ,Europe, began discussions on how to introduce their own emoji sets from 2004 onwards. It wasn't until ,Google, employees requested that ,Unicode, look into the possibility of a uniform emoji set did many companies begin to take the emoji seriously. ,Apple, quickly followed and began to collaborate with not only ,Google,, but also providers in ,Europe, and ,Japan,. In August 2007, ,Mark Davis, and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer wrote the first draft for consideration by the Unicode Technical Committee to introduce emojis into the ,Unicode standard,. Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative efforts from ,Apple Inc., shortly after and the official UTC proposal as co-authors came in January 2009. 
,Separately, a proposal had been submitted in 2008 to add the ,ARIB extended characters, used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode. This included several pictographic symbols.,[39], These were added in Unicode 5.2 in 2009, a year before the cellular emoji sets were fully added; they include several characters which either also appeared amongst the cellular emoji,[29], or were subsequently classified as emoji.,[40],
,Throughout 2009, members of the ,Unicode Consortium, and national standardization bodies of various countries gave feedback and proposed changes to the international standardization of the emoji. The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emojis as the standard set, which would be released in 2010 as Unicode 6.0.,[41],
,
,Modern-day emojis (2010–present),
,The introduction of the new emojis by ,Unicode, in 2009, saw the introduction of some of the most notable emojis used today. The introduction of the new emojis had numerous teething issues, with feedback from many on the cultural differences between different countries and also the misuse. Famously, both the peach and the eggplant were used for other meanings and others were often used for criminal purposes. This led to the gun emoji getting removed and replaced with a water gun.,[,citation needed,],
,The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Unicode 7.0 added approximately 250 emoji, many from the ,Webdings, and ,Wingdings, fonts.,[35], Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including ,Yahoo, and ,MSN Messenger,.,[42], Unicode 8.0 added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the ,taco,, signs of the ,Zodiac,, new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship.,[43], Corporate demand for emoji standardization has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group's traditional focus on standardizing characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records.,[44],
,Emoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification, as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects.,[45], For example, following an Apple tradition, the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July 17, the date in 2002 Apple announced its ,iCal, calendar application for ,macOS,. This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July 17 "",World Emoji Day,"".,[46], Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one.,[47],
,Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network on which the iPhone launched. For example, ,.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace},U+1F483, ,💃, ,.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller{font-size:85%},DANCER, is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.,[48],
,Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original ,glyphs,. For example, ,U+1F485, ,💅, ,NAIL POLISH, has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify ""non-caring fatuousness"" and ""anything from shutting ,haters, down to a sense of accomplishment"".,[49],[50],[51], Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect ,U+1F4BA, ,💺, ,SEAT, to stand for ""a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater"".,[52],
,As of July 2017,[update],, there were 2,666 emoji on the official Unicode Standard list.,[53],
,
,Cultural influence,
,Color illustrations of ,U+1F602, ,😂, ,FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY, from ,Twitter,, ,Noto Emoji Project, and ,Firefox OS,
,Oxford Dictionaries, named ,U+1F602, ,😂, ,FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY,[54], its 2015 ,Word of the Year,.,[55], Oxford noted that 2015 had seen a sizable increase in the use of the word ""emoji"" and recognized its impact on popular culture.,[55], Oxford Dictionaries President Caspar Grathwohl expressed that ""traditional alphabet scripts have been struggling to meet the rapid-fire, visually focused demands of 21st Century communication. It's not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped in to fill those gaps—it's flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully."",[56], ,SwiftKey, found that ""Face with Tears of Joy"" was the most popular emoji across the world.,[57], The ,American Dialect Society, declared ,U+1F346, ,🍆, ,AUBERGINE, to be the ""Most Notable Emoji"" of 2015 in their Word of the Year vote.,[58],
,Some emoji are specific to Japanese culture, such as a ,bowing, businessman (,U+1F647, ,🙇, ,), the ,shoshinsha mark, used to indicate a beginner driver (,U+1F530, ,🔰, ,), a white flower (,U+1F4AE, ,💮, ,) used to denote ""brilliant homework"",,[59], or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ,ramen, noodles (,U+1F35C, ,🍜, ,), ,dango, (,U+1F361, ,🍡, ,), ,onigiri, (,U+1F359, ,🍙, ,), ,Japanese curry, (,U+1F35B, ,🍛, ,), and ,sushi, (,U+1F363, ,🍣, ,). ,Unicode Consortium, founder ,Mark Davis, compared the use of emoji to a developing language, particularly mentioning the American use of eggplant (,U+1F346, ,🍆, ,) to represent a ,phallus,.,[60], Some linguists have classified emoji and ,emoticons, as ,discourse markers,.,[61],
,In December 2015 a ,sentiment analysis, of emoji was published,,[62], and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking 1.0,[63], was provided. In 2016, a musical about emoji premiered in Los Angeles.,[64],[65],  The computer-animated ,The Emoji Movie, was released in summer 2017.,[66],[67],
,In January 2017, in what is believed to be the first large-scale study of emoji usage, researchers at the ,University of Michigan, analysed over 1.2 billion messages input via the Kika Emoji Keyboard,[68], and announced that the Face With Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji. The Heart and the Heart eyes emoji stood second and third respectively. The study also found that the French use heart emoji the most.,[69], People in countries like Australia, France and the Czech Republic used more happy emoji, while this was not so for people in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina, where people used more negative emoji in comparison to cultural hubs known for restraint and self-discipline, like Turkey, France and Russia.,[70],
,There has been discussion among legal experts on whether or not emoji could be admissible as evidence in court trials.,[71],[72], Furthermore, as emoji continue to develop and grow as a ""language"" of symbols, there may also be the potential of the formation of emoji ""dialects"".,[73], Emoji are being used as more than just to show reactions and emotions.,[74], Snapchat have even incorporated emoji in their trophy and friends system with each emoji showing a complex meaning.,[75],
,
,Emoji that further modern causes,
,In the second part of 2019, a ,period, emoji will be released that is expected to break the stigma of menstruation.,[76], In addition to normalizing periods, it will also be relevant to describe medical topics such as donating blood and other blood-related activities.,[76],
,A mosquito emoji was added in 2018 to raise awareness for diseases spread by the insect, such as dengue and malaria.,[77],
,
,Emoji communication problems,
,Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer;,[78], in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.,[79],
,The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.,[80], (See also ,Models of communication,.)
,For example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively, so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and even obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.,[81],
,The second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. Small changes to a character's look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver. As an example, in April 2020, British actress and presenter ,Jameela Jamil, posted a tweet from her iPhone using the Face with Hand Over Mouth emoji (🤭) as part of a comment on people shopping for food during the ,COVID-19 pandemic,. On Apple's ,iOS,, the emoji expression is neutral and pensive, but on other platforms the emoji shows as a giggling face. Many fans were initially upset thinking that she, as a well off celebrity, was mocking poor people, but this was not her intended meaning.,[82],  
,
,Controversial emoji,
,Some emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings. Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed usage of pistol (,U+1F52B, ,🔫, ,), knife (,U+1F5E1, ,🗡, ,), and bomb (,U+1F4A3, ,💣, ,) emoji in ways that were deemed by authorities to constitute credible threats.,[83],
,In the lead-up to the ,2016 Summer Olympics,, the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic-related emoji, including medals and events such as ,handball, and ,water polo,.,[84], By October 2015, these candidate emoji included "",rifle,"" (,U+1F946, ,🥆, ,) and "",modern pentathlon,"" (,U+1F93B, ,🤻, ,).,[85],[86], However, in 2016, Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji, and the characters were added without emoji presentations, meaning that software is expected to render them in black-and-white rather than color, and emoji-specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them. In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.,[83],[86],[87],
,On August 1, 2016, Apple announced that in ,iOS 10,, the pistol emoji (,U+1F52B, ,🔫, ,) would be changed from a realistic ,revolver, to a ,water pistol,.,[83], Conversely, the following day, Microsoft pushed out an update to Windows 10 that changed its longstanding depiction of the pistol emoji as a toy ,ray-gun, to a real revolver.,[88], Microsoft stated that the change was made to bring the glyph more in line with industry-standard designs and customer expectations.,[88], By 2018, most major platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook, and Twitter had transitioned their rendering of the pistol emoji to match Apple's water gun implementation.,[89],
,The ,eggplant, (British English: ,aubergine,) emoji (,U+1F346, ,🍆, ,) has also seen controversy due to its being used, almost solely in North America, to represent a penis.,[58],[60],[90],[91], Beginning in December 2014, the ,hashtag, ,#EggplantFridays, began to rise to popularity on ,Instagram, for use in marking photos featuring clothed or unclothed penises.,[90],[91], This became such a popular trend that beginning in April 2015, Instagram disabled the ability to search for not only the ,#EggplantFridays, tag, but also other eggplant-containing hashtags, including simply ,#eggplant, and ,#🍆,.,[90],[91],[92],
,The peach emoji (,U+1F351, ,🍑, ,) has likewise been used as a euphemistic icon for ,buttocks,, with a 2016 ,Emojipedia, analysis revealing that only 7% of English language tweets with the peach emoji refer to the actual fruit.,[93],[94],[95], In 2016, Apple attempted to redesign the emoji to less resemble buttocks. This was met with fierce backlash in beta testing and Apple reversed its decision by the time it went live to the public.,[96],
,In December 2017, a lawyer in ,Delhi,, India, threatened to file suit against ,WhatsApp, for allowing use of the ,middle finger, emoji (,U+1F595, ,🖕, ,) on the basis that the company is ""directly abetting the use of an offensive, lewd, obscene gesture"" in violation of the ,Indian Penal Code,.,[97],
,
,Emoji versus text presentation,
,Unicode defines ,variation sequences, for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},Emoji characters can have two main kinds of presentation:
,an ,emoji presentation,, with colorful and perhaps whimsical shapes, even animated,
,a ,text presentation,, such as black & white,— ,Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji,[98],
,Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style.,[99],

,Skin color,
,Main article: ,Emoji modifiers,
,Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1-2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 (U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF): 🏻 🏼 🏽 🏾 🏿. They are based on the ,Fitzpatrick scale, for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (,■,), blue (,■,), or gray (,■,).,[98], Non-human emoji (like ,U+26FD, ,⛽, ,FUEL PUMP,) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers.
As of Unicode 13.0, Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 116 human emoji spread across six blocks: ,Dingbats,, ,Emoticons,, ,Miscellaneous Symbols,, ,Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs,, ,Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs,, and ,Transport and Map Symbols,.,[10],
,The following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open-source ""Twemoji"" images, designed by ,Twitter,:

,Joining,
,  ,Behaviour of the ,ZWJ, and ,ZWNJ, format controls with various types of character, including emoji.,
,Implementations may use ,U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, (ZWJ) between emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character.,[98],
(Systems that don't support this should ignore the ZWJ character.)
,For example, the sequence U+1F468 MAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F467 GIRL (👨‍👩‍👧) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that don't support it would ignore the ZWJs, showing the base emoji in the sequence: U+1F468 MAN, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+1F467 GIRL (👨👩👧).
,Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that are supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to only document sequences that are ,recommended for general interchange, (RGI).,[12],
,
,Unicode blocks,
,It has been suggested that this section be ,split, out  into another article titled ,Unicode emojis,. (,Discuss,) ,(October 2019),
,Main articles: ,Dingbats (Unicode block),, ,Emoticons (Unicode block),, ,Miscellaneous Symbols (Unicode block),, ,Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block),, ,Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block),, ,Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A (Unicode block),, and ,Transport and Map Symbols (Unicode block),
,Unicode 13.0 represents emoji using 1,367 characters spread across 24 blocks, of which 26 are ,Regional Indicator Symbols, that combine in pairs to form flag emoji, and 12 (#, * and 0–9) are base characters for ,keycap, emoji sequences:,[10],[98],
,637 of the 768 code points in the ,Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, block are considered emoji. 240 of the 254 code points in the ,Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs, block are considered emoji.  All of the 57 code points in the ,Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A, block are considered emoji.  All of the 80 code points in the ,Emoticons, block are considered emoji. 101 of the 114 code points in the ,Transport and Map Symbols, block are considered emoji. 83 of the 256 code points in the ,Miscellaneous Symbols, block are considered emoji. 33 of the 192 code points in the ,Dingbats, block are considered emoji.

,4.,^, ,""UCD: Emoji Data for UTR #51"",. Unicode Consortium. January 28, 2020.,
,
,Additional emoji can be found in the following Unicode blocks: ,Arrows, (8 code points considered emoji), ,Basic Latin, (12), ,CJK Symbols and Punctuation, (2), ,Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement, (41), ,Enclosed Alphanumerics, (1), ,Enclosed CJK Letters and Months, (2), ,Enclosed Ideographic Supplement, (15), ,General Punctuation, (2), ,Geometric Shapes, (8), ,Geometric Shapes Extended, (12), ,Latin-1 Supplement, (2), ,Letterlike Symbols, (2), ,Mahjong Tiles, (1), ,Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows, (7), ,Miscellaneous Technical, (18), ,Playing Cards, (1), and ,Supplemental Arrows-B, (2).
,
,Additions,
,Some vendors, most notably Microsoft, Samsung and HTC, add emoji presentation to some other existing Unicode characters or coin their own ZWJ sequences.
,Microsoft displays all ,Mahjong tiles, (U+1F000‥2B, not just ,U+1F004, ,🀄, ,MAHJONG TILE RED DRAGON,) and alternative card suits (,U+2661, ,♡, ,, ,U+2662, ,♢, ,, ,U+2664, ,♤, ,, ,U+2666, ,♦, ,) as emoji. They also support additional pencils (,U+270E, ,✎, ,, ,U+2710, ,✐, ,) and a heart-shaped bullet (,U+2765, ,❥, ,).
,While only ,U+261D, ,☝, , is officially an emoji, Microsoft and Samsung add the other three directions as well (,U+261C, ,☜, ,, ,U+261E, ,☞, ,, ,U+261F, ,☟, ,).
Both vendors pair the standard checked ballot box emoji ,U+2611, ,☑, , with its crossed variant ,U+2612, ,☒, ,, but only Samsung also has the empty ballot box ,U+2610, ,☐, ,.
,Samsung almost completely covers the rest of the ,Miscellaneous Symbols, block (U+2600‥FF) as emoji, which includes Chess pieces, game die faces, some traffic sign as well as genealogical and astronomical symbols for instance.
,HTC supports most additional pictographs from the ,Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, (U+1F300‥5FF) and ,Transport and Map Symbols, (U+1F680‥FF) blocks. Some of them are also shown as emoji on Samsung devices.
,The open source projects Emojidex and Emojitwo are trying to cover all of these extensions established by major vendors.
,
,Implementation,
,The exact appearance of emoji is not prescribed but varies between fonts, in the same way that normal typefaces can display letters differently. For example, the ,Apple Color Emoji, typeface is proprietary to Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices (without additional ,hacking,).,[100], Different computing companies have developed their own fonts to display emoji, some of which have been ,open-sourced, to permit their reuse.,[101],[102], Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.,[103],
,
,Android,
,Android, devices support emoji differently depending on the operating system version. Google added native emoji support to Android in July 2013 with Android 4.3,,[104], and to the Google Keyboard in November 2013 for devices running Android 4.4 and later.,[105], Android 7.0 Nougat added Unicode 9 emoji, skin tone modifiers, and a redesign of many existing emoji.,[106],
,Emoji are also supported by the ,Google Hangouts, application (independent of the keyboard in use), in both Hangouts and ,SMS, modes.,[107], Several third-party messaging and keyboard applications (such as IQQI Keyboard) for Android devices,[108], provide plugins that allow the use of emoji. Some apps, e.g. ,WhatsApp,, come with Apple emoji for internal use.,[,clarification needed,], With Android 8 (Oreo), Google added a compatibility library that, if included by app developers, makes the latest Noto emoji available on any platform since Android 4.3.,[109],
,Until 2016, mobile phone vendors HTC and LG deployed variants of NotoColorEmoji.ttf with custom glyphs; Samsung still does. Some Japanese mobile carriers used to equip branded Android devices with emoji glyphs that were closer to the original ones, but apparently have stopped updating these circa 2015.,[,clarification needed,],
,
,Apple,
,Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of ,OS X, ,10.7 Lion,, in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the ""Characters"" special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the ""Edit"" menu and pulling down to ""Special Characters"", or by the key combination ,⌘ Command,+,⌥ Option,+,T,. The desktop OS uses the ,Apple Color Emoji, font that was introduced earlier in ,iOS,. This provides users with full color pictographs.,[110],
,The emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of ,iPhone OS version 2.2, in 2008.,[111], The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until ,iOS version 5.0,.,[112], From iPhone OS 2.2 through to iOS 4.3.5 (2011), those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third party app to enable it. The first of such apps was developed by ,Josh Gare,; emoji beginning to be embraced by popular culture outside Japan has been attributed to these apps.,[113],[114], iOS was updated to support ,Fitzpatrick skin-tone modifiers, with version 8.3.,[115],
,OS X 10.9 Mavericks, introduced a dedicated emoji input palette in most text input boxes using the key combination ,⌘ Command,+,Ctrl,+,Space,.,[116],
,Apple has revealed that the ""face with tears of joy"" is the most popular emoji among English speaking Americans. On second place is the ""heart"" emoji followed by the ""Loudly Crying Face"".,[117],[118],
,On July 17, 2018, for the ,World Emoji Day,, Apple announced that it will be adding 70 more emoji in its 2018 ,iOS, update, including the long-awaited, red hair, white hair, curly hair and bald emoji.,[119],[120],
,On September 12, 2017, Apple announced that the ,Messages, app on the ,iPhones, with ,Face ID, would get ""animoji"", which are versions of standard emoji that are custom-animated with the use of ,facial motion capture, to reflect the sender's expressions. These animoji can also utilize ,lip sync, to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered. A select set of these models are being reused for creating still images and short animations dynamically.
,With the release of ,iOS 13,, Apple introduced ""memoji"" that allows the use of an avatar that a user can use to personalize messages; this feature does not require Face ID.,[121],
,
,Chrome OS,
,Chrome OS,, through its inclusion of the ,Noto fonts,, supports the emoji set introduced through Unicode 6.2. As of Chrome OS 41, Noto Color Emoji is the default font for most emoji.
,
,Linux,
,Ubuntu 18.04, and ,Fedora, 28 support color emoji by default, using ,Noto Color Emoji,.,[122],[123], Some ,Linux distributions, require the installation of extra fonts.,[124], Color emoji are supported by ,FreeType, and ,Cairo,.,[125],[126],
,
,Microsoft Windows,
,An update for the Segoe UI Symbol font in ,Windows 7, and in Windows Server 2008 R2 brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems.,[127], The font update rebranded the font as ,Segoe UI Symbol,. The difference between the two fonts is that Segoe UI lacks any and all emoji characters, while Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. ,Windows 8, and higher supports the full Unicode emoji characters through Microsoft's ,Segoe UI, family of fonts. Emoji characters are accessed through the onscreen keyboard's ""smiley"" key. As of ,Windows 8.1, Preview, Segoe UI Emoji font supplies full-color pictographs. Differently from macOS and iOS, color glyphs are only supplied when the application supports Microsoft's ,DirectWrite, API, and Segoe UI Emoji is explicitly declared, otherwise monochrome glyphs appear.,[128], Segoe UI Emoji and its full-color emoji set is not fully supported by all programs written for Windows; for example, among Web browsers, ,Internet Explorer, and ,Google Chrome, can use the font, but ,Firefox, initially did not (that browser now supports full color emoji and includes the EmojiOne set in installation). ,Windows 10 Anniversary Update, added Unicode 9 emoji.,[129],
,
,Internationalized domain names,
,Main articles: ,Emoji domain, and ,Internationalized domain name,
,A limited number of ,top-level domains, allow registration of domain names containing emoji characters. Emoji-containing subdomains are also possible under any top-level domain.
,
,Social media,
,Facebook, and ,Twitter, replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics.
,Facebook has different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service, where only the former provides complete coverage. ,Facebook reactions, are only partially compatible with standard emoji.,[,citation needed,],
,Twitter has released Twemoji, which is their emoji graphics together with a Javascript library to handle them, under the ,Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license, and the ,MIT open-source license,, respectively.,[130], The Android and iOS Twitter apps use emoji native to the platform they are running on.,[,clarification needed,],
,
,General,
,Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font.
,EmojiOne version 2.3, an open-source font available under free license, supports the full emoji set in color through Unicode Emoji 3.0, i.e. Unicode 9.0. EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.
,Note, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. ,OpenType, version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon ,SVG, and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon ,PNG, chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.
,The font ,Symbola, contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a ,public domain font,; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works. Other typefaces including a significant number of emoji characters include ,Noto Emoji,, Adobe Source Emoji, and ,Quivira,.
,
,In popular culture,
,The 2009 film ,Moon, featured a robot named GERTY who communicates using a neutral-toned synthesized voice together with a screen showing emoji representing the corresponding emotional content.,[131],
,In 2014, the ,Library of Congress, acquired an emoji version of ,Herman Melville,'s ,Moby Dick, created by Fred Benenson.,[132],[133],
,A musical called ,Emojiland, premiered at Rockwell Table & Stage in Los Angeles in May 2016,,[64],[65], after selected songs were presented at the same venue in 2015.,[134],[135],
,In October 2016, the ,Museum of Modern Art, acquired the original collection of emoji distributed by NTT Docomo in 1999.,[136],
,In November 2016, the first emoji-themed convention, Emojicon, was held in San Francisco.,[137],
,In March 2017, the first episode of ,the fifth season of ,Samurai Jack, featured alien characters who communicate in emoji.,[138],
,In April 2017, the ,Doctor Who, episode "",Smile,"" featured nanobots called Vardy, which communicate through robotic avatars that use emoji (without any accompanying speech output) and are sometimes referred to by the time travelers as ""Emojibots"".,[139],
,On July 28, 2017, ,Sony Pictures Animation, released ,The Emoji Movie,, a 3D computer animated movie featuring the voices of ,Patrick Stewart,, ,Christina Aguilera,, ,Sofía Vergara,, ,Anna Faris,, ,T. J. Miller,, and other notable actors and comedians.,[140],

,The ,canvas element, is part of ,HTML5, and allows for dynamic, ,scriptable, ,rendering, of 2D shapes and ,bitmap, images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a ,bitmap, and does not have a built-in ,scene graph,, but through ,WebGL, it allows 3D shapes and images to be displayed. HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games.

,History,[,edit,],
,Canvas was initially introduced by ,Apple, for use in their own ,Mac OS X, ,WebKit, component in 2004,,[1], powering applications like ,Dashboard, widgets and the ,Safari, browser. Later, in 2005 it was adopted in version 1.8 of ,Gecko, browsers,,[2], and ,Opera, in 2006,,[3], and standardized by the ,Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, (WHATWG) on new proposed specifications for next generation web technologies.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,A ,canvas, consists of a drawable region defined in ,HTML, code with ,height, and ,width, attributes. ,JavaScript, code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to those of other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics. Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition.
,
,Example,[,edit,],
,The following code creates a Canvas element in an HTML page:
,
,<,canvas, ,id,=,""example"", ,width,=,""200"", ,height,=,""200"",>,
This text is displayed if your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
,</,canvas,>,
,
,Using JavaScript, you can draw on the canvas:
,
,var, ,example, ,=, ,document,.,getElementById,(,'example',);,
,var, ,context, ,=, ,example,.,getContext,(,'2d',);,
,context,.,fillStyle, ,=, ,'red',;,
,context,.,fillRect,(,30,,, ,30,,, ,50,,, ,50,);,
,
,This code draws a red rectangle on the screen.
,The Canvas API also provides ,save(), and ,restore(),, for saving and restoring all the canvas context's attributes.
,
,Canvas element size versus drawing surface size,[,edit,],
,A canvas actually has two sizes: the size of the element itself and the size of the element's drawing surface.  Setting the element's width and height attributes sets both of these sizes; CSS attributes affect only the element's size and not the drawing surface.
,By default, both the canvas element's size and the size of its drawing surface is 300 screen pixels wide and 150 screen pixels high. In the listing shown in the example, which uses CSS to set the canvas element's size, the size of the element is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels high, but the size of the drawing surface remains unchanged at the default value of 300 pixels × 150 pixels. When a canvas element's size does not match the size of its drawing surface, the browser scales the drawing surface to fit the element (which may result in surprising and unwanted effects).
,Example on setting element size and drawing surface size to different values:
,
,<!DOCTYPE html>,
,<,html,>,
    ,<,head,>,
    ,<,title,>,Canvas element size: 600 x 300,
    Canvas drawing surface size: 300 x 150,</,title,>,
    ,<,style,>,
        ,body, ,{,
            ,background,:, ,#dddddd,;,
        ,},
        ,#,canvas, ,{,
            ,margin,:, ,20,px,;,
            ,padding,:, ,20,px,;,
            ,background,:, ,#ffffff,;,
            ,border,:, ,thin, ,inset, ,#aaaaaa,;,
            ,width,:, ,600,px,;,
            ,height,:, ,300,px,;,
        ,},
    ,</,style,>,
    ,</,head,>,
    ,<,body,>,
        ,<,canvas, ,id,=,""canvas"",>,
        Canvas not supported
        ,</,canvas,>,
    ,</,body,>,

,Canvas versus Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG),[,edit,],

,SVG, is an earlier standard for drawing shapes in browsers. However, unlike canvas, which is ,raster,-based, SVG is ,vector,-based, so that each drawn shape is remembered as an object in a ,scene graph, or ,Document Object Model,, which is subsequently rendered to a bitmap.  This means that if attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the scene.
,Canvas objects, on the other hand, are drawn in ,immediate mode,. In the canvas example above, once the rectangle is drawn the model it was drawn from is forgotten by the system. If its position were to be changed, the entire scene would need to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the rectangle. But in the equivalent SVG case, one could simply change the position attributes of the rectangle and the browser would determine how to repaint it. There are additional JavaScript libraries that add scene-graph capabilities to the canvas element. It is also possible to paint a canvas in layers and then recreate specific layers.
,SVG images are represented in ,XML,, and complex scenes can be created and maintained with XML editing tools.
,The SVG scene graph enables ,event handlers, to be associated with objects, so a rectangle may respond to an ,onClick, event. To get the same functionality with canvas, one must manually match the coordinates of the mouse click with the coordinates of the drawn rectangle to determine whether it was clicked.
,Conceptually, canvas is a lower-level API upon which an engine, supporting for example SVG, might be built. There are JavaScript libraries that provide partial SVG implementations using canvas for browsers that do not provide SVG but support canvas, such as the browsers in Android 2.x. However, this is not normally the case—they are independent standards. The situation is complicated because there are scene graph libraries for canvas, and SVG has some bitmap manipulation functionality.
,
,Reactions,[,edit,],
,At the time of its introduction the canvas element was met with mixed reactions from the web standards community. There have been arguments against Apple's decision to create a new proprietary element instead of supporting the ,SVG, standard. There are other concerns about syntax, such as the absence of a ,namespace,.,[4],
,
,Intellectual property over canvas,[,edit,],
,On March 14, 2007, WebKit developer ,Dave Hyatt, forwarded an email from Apple's Senior Patent Counsel, Helene Plotka Workman,,[5], which stated that Apple reserved all ,intellectual property, rights relative to WHATWG's Web Applications 1.0 Working Draft, dated March 24, 2005, Section 10.1, entitled “Graphics:  The bitmap canvas”,,[6], but left the door open to licensing the patents should the specification be transferred to a standards body with a ,formal patent policy,. This caused considerable discussion among web developers, and raised questions concerning the WHATWG's lack of a policy on patents in comparison to the ,World Wide Web Consortium, (W3C)'s explicit favoring of royalty-free licenses. Apple later disclosed the patents under the W3C's royalty-free patent licensing terms.,[7], The disclosure means that Apple is required to provide royalty-free licensing for the patent whenever the Canvas element becomes part of a future W3C recommendation created by the HTML working group.,[8],
,
,Privacy concerns,[,edit,],
,Canvas fingerprinting, is one of a number of ,browser fingerprinting, techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to identify and track visitors using ,HTML5, canvas element. The technique received wide media coverage in 2014,[9],[10],[11],[12], after researchers from ,Princeton University, and ,KU Leuven University, described it in their paper ,The Web never forgets,.,[13], The privacy concerns regarding canvas fingerprinting centre around the fact that even deleting cookies and clearing the cache will not be sufficient for users to avoid online tracking.
,
,Browser support,[,edit,],
,The element is supported by the current versions of ,Mozilla Firefox,, ,Google Chrome,, ,Internet Explorer,, ,Safari,, ,Konqueror,, ,Opera,[14], and ,Microsoft Edge,.,[15],

,Company overview,[,edit,],
,  ,Former LinkedIn headquarters on Stierlin Court in ,Mountain View, California,
,Founded in ,Mountain View, California,, LinkedIn is currently ,headquartered, in ,San Francisco, California,, with 33 global offices in ,Omaha,, ,Chicago,, ,Los Angeles,, ,New York,, ,Washington, D.C.,, ,São Paulo,, ,London,, ,Dublin,, ,Amsterdam,, ,Graz,, ,Milan,, ,Paris,, ,Munich,, ,Madrid,, ,Stockholm,, ,Singapore,, ,Hong Kong,, ,China,, ,Japan,, ,Australia,, ,Canada,, ,India, and ,Dubai,. In May 2020, the company had around 20,500 ,employees,.,[10],
,LinkedIn's ,CEO, is ,Jeff Weiner,,,[11], previously a ,Yahoo!, Inc. executive. Founder ,Reid Hoffman,, previously CEO of LinkedIn, is Chairman of the Board.,[11],[12], It is funded by ,Sequoia Capital,, ,Greylock,, ,Bain Capital Ventures,,,[13], ,Bessemer Venture Partners, and the European Founders Fund.,[14], LinkedIn reached profitability in March 2006.,[15], Through January 2011, the company had received a total of $103 million of ,investment,.,[16],
,The site has an ,Alexa Internet, ranking as the 57th most popular website (May 2020). ,[17], According to the ,New York Times,, US high school students are now creating LinkedIn profiles to include with their college applications.,[18], Based in the United States, the site is, as of 2013, available in 24 languages,,[11], including ,Arabic,, ,Chinese,, ,English,, ,French,, ,German,, ,Italian,, ,Portuguese,, ,Spanish,, ,Dutch,, ,Swedish,, ,Danish,, ,Romanian,, ,Russian,, ,Turkish,, ,Japanese,, ,Czech,, ,Polish,, ,Korean,, ,Indonesian,, ,Malay,, and ,Tagalog,.,[19],[20], LinkedIn filed for an ,initial public offering, in January 2011 and traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the ,NYSE, ,symbol, ""LNKD"".,[21],
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Founding to 2010,[,edit,],
,The company was founded in December 2002  by ,Reid Hoffman, and founding team members from ,PayPal, and Socialnet.com (Allen Blue, ,Eric Ly,, Jean-Luc Vaillant, Lee Hower, Konstantin Guericke, Stephen Beitzel, David Eves, Ian McNish, Yan Pujante, Chris Saccheri).,[22], In late 2003, ,Sequoia Capital, led the ,Series A, investment in the company.,[23], In August 2004, LinkedIn reached 1 million users.,[24], In March 2006, LinkedIn achieved its first month of profitability.,[24], In April 2007, LinkedIn reached 10 million users.,[24], In February 2008, LinkedIn launched a mobile version of the site.,[25],
,In June 2008, Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, and other ,venture capital, firms purchased a 5% ,stake, in the company for $53 million, giving the company a ,post-money valuation, of approximately $1 billion.,[26], In November 2009, LinkedIn opened its office in Mumbai,[27], and soon thereafter in Sydney, as it started its Asia-Pacific team expansion. In 2010, LinkedIn opened an International Headquarters in Dublin, ,Ireland,,,[28], received a $20 million investment from ,Tiger Global Management LLC, at a valuation of approximately $2 billion,,[29], announced its first acquisition, Mspoke,,[30], and improved its 1% ,premium, subscription ratio.,[31], In October of that year, Silicon Valley Insider ranked the company No. 10 on its Top 100 List of most valuable startups.,[32], By December, the company was valued at $1.575 billion in private markets.,[33],
,
,2011 to present,[,edit,],
,  ,LinkedIn office building at ,222 Second Street, in San Francisco (opened in March 2016),
,  ,LinkedIn office in Toronto,
,LinkedIn filed for an ,initial public offering, in January 2011. The company traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol ""LNKD"", at $45 per share. Shares of LinkedIn rose as much as 171% on their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange and closed at $94.25, more than 109% above ,IPO, price. Shortly after the IPO, the site's underlying ,infrastructure, was revised to allow accelerated revision-release cycles.,[11], In 2011, LinkedIn earned $154.6 million in ,advertising, revenue alone, surpassing ,Twitter,, which earned $139.5 million.,[34], LinkedIn's fourth-,quarter, 2011 earnings soared because of the company's increase in success in the social media world.,[35], By this point, LinkedIn had about 2,100 full-time employees compared to the 500 that it had in 2010.,[36],
,In April 2014, LinkedIn announced that it had leased ,222 Second Street,, a 26-story building under construction in ,San Francisco's SoMa, district, to accommodate up to 2,500 of its employees,,[37], with the lease covering 10 years.,[38], The goal was to join all San Francisco-based staff (1,250 as of January 2016) in one building, bringing sales and ,marketing, employees together with the ,research and development, team.,[38], They started to move in in March 2016.,[38], In February 2016, following an ,earnings, report, LinkedIn's shares dropped 43.6% within a single day, down to $108.38 per share. LinkedIn lost $10 billion of its ,market capitalization, that day.,[39],[40],
,On June 13, 2016, ,Microsoft, announced that it would acquire LinkedIn for $196 a share, a total value of $26.2 billion and the largest ,acquisition made by Microsoft, to date. The acquisition would be an all-cash, debt-financed transaction. Microsoft would allow LinkedIn to ""retain its distinct brand, culture and independence"", with Weiner to remain as CEO, who would then report to Microsoft CEO ,Satya Nadella,. Analysts believed Microsoft saw the opportunity to integrate LinkedIn with its ,Office product suite, to help better integrate the professional network system with its ,products,. The deal was completed on December 8, 2016.,[41],
,In late 2016, LinkedIn announced a planned increase of 200 new positions in its Dublin office, which would bring the total employee count to 1,200.,[42],
,As of 2017, 94% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn to distribute content.,[43],
,Soon after LinkedIn's acquisition by Microsoft, on January 19, 2017, LinkedIn's new desktop version was introduced.,[44], The new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop. Some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app. Features that were not heavily used were removed. For example, the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more.,[45],
,Following the launch of the new ,user interface, (UI), some users, complained about the missing features which were there in the older version, slowness, and bugs in it. The issues were faced by both free and premium users, and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site.
,In 2019, LinkedIn launched globally the feature Open for Business,[46], that enables freelancers to be discovered on the platform. LinkedIn Events was launched in the same year.,[47],
,In February 2020, LinkedIn announced that Jeff Weiner will step down as CEO and become executive chairman after 11 years in the role. Ryan Roslansky, the current senior vice president of product, will become CEO as of June 1, 2020.,[48],

,Perkins Lawsuit,[,edit,],
,In 2013, a ,class action, ,lawsuit, entitled ,Perkins vs. LinkedIn Corp, was filed against the company, accusing it of automatically sending invitations to contacts in a member's ,email address, book without permission. The court agreed with LinkedIn that permission had in fact been given for invitations to be sent, but ,not, for the two further reminder ,emails,.,[73], LinkedIn settled the lawsuit in 2015 for $13 million.,[74], Many members should have received a notice in their email with the subject line ""Legal Notice of Settlement of Class Action"". The Case No. is 13-CV-04303-LHK.,[75],
,
,hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn,
,In May 2017, LinkedIn sent a Cease-And-Desist letter to hiQ Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that collects data from public profiles and provides analysis of this data to its customers. The letter demanded that hiQ immediately cease ""scraping"" data from LinkedIn's servers, claiming violations of the CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) and the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).
,In response, hiQ sued LinkedIn in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, asking the court to prohibit LinkedIn from blocking its access to public profiles while the court considered the merits of its request. The court served a preliminary injunction against LinkedIn, which was then forced to allow hiQ to continue to collect public data. LinkedIn appealed this ruling; in September 2019, the appeals court rejected LinkedIn's arguments and the preliminary injunction was upheld.,[76], The dispute is ongoing.
,
,Membership,[,edit,],
,  ,Social media websites can also use ""traditional"" marketing approaches, as seen in these LinkedIn-branded chocolates.,
,As of 2015, LinkedIn had more than 400 million members in over 200 countries and territories.,[11],[77], It is significantly ahead of its competitors ,Viadeo, (50 million as of 2013),[78], and ,XING, (11 million as of 2016).,[79], In 2011, its membership grew by approximately two new members every second.,[80], As of 2020, there are over 690 million LinkedIn members.,[4],[81],
,
,Platform and features,[,edit,],
,User profile network,[,edit,],
,Basic functionality,[,edit,],
,The basic functionality of LinkedIn allows users (workers and employers) to create ,profiles,, which for employees typically consist of a ,curriculum vitae, describing their work experience, education and training, skills, and a personal photo. Employers can list ,jobs, and search for potential candidates. Users can ,find jobs,, people and business opportunities recommended by someone in one's contact network. Users can save (i.e. bookmark) jobs that they would like to ,apply, for. Users also have the ability to follow different companies.
,The site also enables members to make ""connections"" to each other in an ,online, ,social network, which may represent real-world ,professional relationships,. Members can invite anyone (whether a site member or not) to become a connection. However, if the invitee selects ""I don't know"" or "",Spam,"", this counts against the inviter. If the inviter gets too many of such responses, the member's account may be ,restricted or closed,.,[9], Users can obtain introductions to the connections of connections (termed ,second-degree connections,) and connections of second-degree connections (termed ,third-degree connections,).
,A member's list of connections can be used in a number of ways. For example, users can search for second-degree connections (such as hiring managers) who work at a company they are interested in, and then ask a specific first-degree connection in common for an introduction.,[82], The ""gated-access approach"" (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship, or the intervention of a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service's users. LinkedIn participated in the EU's ,International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles,.,[83],
,Users can interact with each other in a variety of ways:
,
,Connections can interact by choosing to ""like"" posts and ""congratulate"" others on updates such as birthdays, anniversaries and new positions, as well as by direct messaging.,
,Users can share video with text and filters with the introduction of LinkedIn Video.,[84],[85],
,Users can write posts and articles,[86], within the LinkedIn platform to share with their network.,
,Since September 2012, LinkedIn has enabled users to ""endorse"" each other's skills. However, there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content.,[87], LinkedIn solicits endorsements using ,algorithms, that generate skills members might have. Members cannot opt out of such solicitations, with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a non-existent skill.,[88],
,
,Applications,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn 'applications' often refers to external third party applications that interact with LinkedIn's developer API. However, in some cases, it could refer to sanctioned applications featured on a user's profile page.
,
,External, third party applications,[,edit,],
,On February 12, 2015, LinkedIn released an updated terms of use for their developer API.,[89], The developer API allows both companies and individuals the ability to interact with LinkedIn's data through creation of managed third party applications. Applications must go through a review process and request permission from the user before accessing a user's data.
,Normal use of the API is outlined in LinkedIn's developer documents,,[90], including:
,
,Sign into external services using LinkedIn,
,Add items or attributes to a user profile,
,Share items or articles to user's timeline,
,Embedded in profile,[,edit,],
,In October 2008, LinkedIn enabled an ""applications platform"" which allows external online services to be embedded within a member's profile page. Among the initial applications were an ,Amazon, Reading List that allows LinkedIn members to display books they are reading, a connection to Tripit, and a ,Six Apart,, ,WordPress, and ,TypePad, application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their LinkedIn profile.,[91], In November 2010, LinkedIn allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages; it also permitted LinkedIn members to ""recommend"" products and services and write reviews.,[92], Shortly after, some of the external services were no longer supported, including Amazon's Reading List.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Mobile,[,edit,],
,A mobile version of the site was launched in February 2008, which gives access to a reduced feature set over a ,mobile phone,. The mobile service is available in six languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish.,[93], In January 2011, LinkedIn acquired CardMunch, a ,mobile app, maker that scans ,business cards, and converts into contacts.,[94], In June 2013, CardMunch was noted as an available LinkedIn app.,[11], In August 2011, LinkedIn revamped its mobile applications on the ,iPhone,, ,Android, and ,HTML5,. At the time, ,mobile page, views of the application were increasing roughly 400% year over year according to CEO Jeff Weiner.,[95], In October 2013, LinkedIn announced a service for iPhone users called ""Intro"", which inserts a thumbnail of a person's LinkedIn profile in correspondence with that person when reading mail messages in the native iOS ,Mail program,.,[96], This is accomplished by re-routing all emails from and to the iPhone through LinkedIn ,servers,, which security firm Bishop Fox asserts has serious ,privacy implications,, violates many organizations' ,security policies,, and resembles a ,man-in-the-middle attack,.,[97],[98],
,
,Groups,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn also supports the formation of interest groups, and as of March 29, 2012 there are 1,248,019 such groups whose membership varies from 1 to 744,662.,[99],[100], Groups support a limited form of discussion area, moderated by the group owners and managers.,[101], Groups may be private, accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read, though they must join in order to post messages. Since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of ,anti-spam solutions,, there is a constant stream of spam postings, and there now exists a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose. LinkedIn has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam,,[102], but recently,[,when?,], took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammers.,[,citation needed,], Groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group, including most talked about discussions within your professional circles.,[99],[103],
,In December 2011, LinkedIn announced that they are rolling out polls to groups.,[104], In November 2013, LinkedIn announced the addition of Showcase Pages to the platform.,[105], In 2014, LinkedIn announced they were going to be removing Product and Services Pages,[106], paving the way for a greater focus on Showcase Pages.,[107],
,
,Discontinued features,[,edit,],
,In January 2013, LinkedIn dropped support for LinkedIn Answers and cited a new 'focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across LinkedIn' as the reason for the retirement of the feature. The feature had been launched in 2007 and allowed users to post question to their network and allowed users to rank answers.
,On September 1, 2014, LinkedIn retired InMaps, a feature which allowed you to visualize your professional network.,[108], The feature had been in use since January 2011.
,According to the company's website, LinkedIn Referrals will no longer be available after May 18, 2018.,[109],
,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,Personal branding,[,edit,],
,  ,When a user accepts an invitation from another user, they have a first-level connection; the user is indirectly connected to the other user's connections with what LinkedIn terms second-level and third-level connections.,
,LinkedIn is particularly well-suited for ,personal branding, which, according to Sandra Long, entails ""actively managing one's image and unique value"" to position oneself for career opportunities.,[110], LinkedIn has evolved from being a mere platform for job searchers into a social network which allows users a chance to create a personal brand.,[111], Career coach Pamela Green describes a personal brand as the ""emotional experience you want people to have as a result of interacting with you,"" and a LinkedIn profile is an aspect of that.,[112], A contrasting report suggests that a personal brand is a ""a public-facing persona, exhibited on LinkedIn, Twitter and other networks, that showcases expertise and fosters new connections."",[113],
,LinkedIn allows professionals to build exposure for their personal brand within the site itself as well as in the World Wide Web as a whole. With a tool that LinkedIn dubs a ,Profile Strength Meter,, the site encourages users to offer enough information in their profile to optimize ,visibility by search engines,. It can strengthen a user's LinkedIn presence if he or she belongs to professional groups in the site.,[114],[110], The site enables users to add video to their profiles.,[115], Some users hire a professional photographer for one's profile photo.,[116], Video presentations can be added to one's profile.,[117], LinkedIn's capabilities have been expanding so rapidly that a cottage industry of outside consultants has grown up to help users navigate the system.,[118],[115],[119], A particular emphasis is helping users with their LinkedIn profiles.,[118],

,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},There’s no hiding in the long grass on LinkedIn ... The number one mistake people make on the profile is to not have a photo.,— ,Sandra Long of Post Road Consulting, 2017,[120],In October 2012, LinkedIn launched the  LinkedIn Influencers program, which features global ,thought leaders, who share their professional insights with LinkedIn's members. As of May 2016, there are 750+ Influencers, approximately 74% of which are male.,[121], The program is invite-only and features leaders from a range of industries including ,Richard Branson,, ,Narendra Modi,, ,Arianna Huffington,, ,Greg McKeown,, ,Rahm Emanuel,, ,Jamie Dimon,, ,Martha Stewart,, ,Deepak Chopra,, ,Jack Welch,, and ,Bill Gates,.,[122],[123],
,Job Seeking,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn is widely used by job seekers and employers. According to Jack Meyer, the site has become the ""premier digital platform"" for professionals to network online.,[114], For example, in Australia, which has approximately twelve million working professionals, ten million of them are on LinkedIn, according to Anastasia Santaraneos, suggesting that the probability was high that one's ""future employer is probably on the site."",[124], According to one estimate based on worldwide figures, 122 million users got ,job interviews, via LinkedIn and 35 million were hired by a LinkedIn online connection.,[125],
,LinkedIn allows users to research companies, non-profit organizations, and governments they may be interested in working for. Typing the name of a company or organization in the search box causes pop-up data about the company or organization to appear. Such data may include the ratio of female to male employees, the percentage of the most common titles/positions held within the company, the location of the company's headquarters and offices, and a list of present and former employees. In July 2011, LinkedIn launched a new feature allowing companies to include an ""Apply with LinkedIn"" button on job listing pages.,[126], The new plugin allowed potential employees to apply for positions using their LinkedIn profiles as resumes.,[126], Recruiters also often join industry-based groups on LinkedIn to create connections with professionals in that line of business.,[127],
,Not only helping job applicants meet employers, LinkedIn can help small businesses connect with customers.,[128], Connections are important in boosting a user's standing and presence in LinkedIn. In the site's parlance, two users have a ""first-degree connection"" when one accepts an invitation from another.,[125], People connected to each of them are ""second-degree connections"" and persons connected to the second-degree connections are ""third-degree connections."",[125], This forms a user's internal LinkedIn network. As these connections get stronger and deeper, the user's profile is more likely to appear in searches by employers and others.
,LinkedIn's Profinder is a marketplace where freelancers can (for a monthly subscription fee) bid for project proposals submitted by individuals and small businesses .,[129], In 2017, it had around 60,000 freelancers in more than 140 service areas, such as headshot photography, bookkeeping or tax filing.,[129],
,The premise for connecting with someone has shifted significantly in recent years. Prior to the 2017 new interface being launched, LinkedIn encouraged connections between people who'd already worked together, studied together, done business together or the like. Since 2017 that step has been removed from the connection request process - and users are allowed to connect with up to 30,000 people. This change means LinkedIn is now far more of a proactive networking site, be that for job applicants trying to secure a career move or for salespeople wanting to generate new client leads.,[110],
,
,Communication During COVID-19,[,edit,],
,Since the disruption of COVID-19, LinkedIn has taken thought-out measures to keep their workers and the public safe, while producing the same quality service to their users. According to a LinkedIn livestream run by LinkedIn’s Managing Director, Caroline Fairchild, LinkedIn is a platform that maps well to being able to work remotely,[130],. By keeping up the functionality of LinkedIn, company leaders have been able to use the platform to provide transparent updates to their consumers. During these unprecedented times, companies have seen the benefit of sharing decision making with customers with transparency through LinkedIn posts. 
,
,Top Companies,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn Top Companies, is a series of lists published by LinkedIn, identifying companies in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom that are attracting the most intense interest from job candidates. The 2019 lists identified ,Google,'s parent company, ,Alphabet,, as the most sought-after U.S. company, with ,Facebook, ranked second and ,Amazon, ranked third.,[131], The lists are based on more than one billion actions by LinkedIn members worldwide. The Top Companies lists were started in 2016 and are published annually.
,
,Advertising and for-pay research,[,edit,],
,In mid-2008, LinkedIn launched LinkedIn DirectAds as a form of sponsored advertising.,[132], In October 2008, LinkedIn revealed plans to open its social network of 30 million professionals globally as a potential sample for business-to-business research. It is testing a potential social network revenue model – research that to some appears more promising than advertising.,[133], On July 23, 2013, LinkedIn announced their Sponsored Updates ad service. Individuals and companies can now pay a fee to have LinkedIn sponsor their content and spread it to their user base. This is a common way for social media sites such as LinkedIn to generate revenue.,[134],
,
,Publishing platform,[,edit,],
,On May 7, 2015, LinkedIn added an analytics tool to its publishing platform. The tool allows authors to better track traffic that their posts receive.,[135],
,
,Future plans,[,edit,],
,Economic graph,[,edit,],
,Inspired by ,Facebook,'s "",social graph,"", LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner set a goal in 2012 to create an ""economic graph"" within a decade.,[136], The goal is to create a comprehensive digital map of the world economy and the connections within it.,[137], The economic graph was to be built on the company's current platform with data nodes including companies, jobs, skills, volunteer opportunities, educational institutions, and content.,[138],[139],[140], They have been hoping to include all the job listings in the world, all the skills required to get those jobs, all the professionals who could fill them, and all the companies (nonprofit and for-profit) at which they work.,[138], The ultimate goal is to make the world economy and job market more efficient through increased transparency.,[136], In June 2014, the company announced its ""Galene"" search architecture to give users access to the economic graph's data with more thorough filtering of data, via user searches like ""Engineers with Hadoop experience in Brazil."",[141],[142],
,LinkedIn has used economic graph data to research several topics on the job market, including popular destination cities of recent college graduates,,[143], areas with high concentrations of technology skills,,[144], and common career transitions.,[145], LinkedIn provided the City of New York with data from economic graph showing ""in-demand"" tech skills for the city's ""Tech Talent Pipeline"" project.,[146],
,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn has been described by online ,trade publication, ,TechRepublic, as having ""become the de facto tool for professional networking"".,[147], LinkedIn has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships.,[148], ""LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today,"" according to ,Forbes,.,[149], LinkedIn has inspired the creation of specialised professional networking opportunities, such as co-founder Eddie Lou's Chicago startup, ,Shiftgig, (released in 2012 as a platform for hourly workers).,[150],
,
,Criticism and controversies,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn has received criticism, primarily regarding e-mail address mining and auto-update.
Changing the description below a member's name is seen as a change in a job title, even if it is just a wording change or even a change to ""unemployed"". Unless a member opts to ""turn off activity updates"", an update is sent to all of that person's contacts, telling them to congratulate the member on the ""new job"".,[151],
,The feature that allows LinkedIn members to ""endorse"" each other's skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless, since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the member's skills.,[152], In October 2016, LinkedIn acknowledged that it ""really does matter who endorsed you"" and began highlighting endorsements from ""coworkers and other mutual connections"" to address the criticism.,[153],
,
,Use of e-mail accounts of members for spam sending,[,edit,],
,LinkedIn sends ""invite emails"" to Outlook contacts from its members' email accounts, without obtaining their consent. The ""invitations"" give the impression that the e-mail holder themself has sent the invitation. If there is no response, the answer will be repeated several times (""You have not yet answered XY's invitation."") LinkedIn was sued in the United States on charges of hijacking e-mail accounts and spamming. The company argued with the right to freedom of expression. In addition, the users concerned would be supported in building a network.,[154],[155],[156],
,The sign-up process includes a step for users to enter their email password (there is an opt-out feature). LinkedIn will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in that address book or that the user has had email conversations with. When the member's email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to ""selected"" email addresses, or to all. LinkedIn was sued for sending out another two follow-up invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial, authorized, invitation. 
,In November 2014, LinkedIn lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of people's names and images without authorization.,[157],[158],[159], The lawsuit was eventually settled in 2015 in favor of LinkedIn members.,[74],
,
,Security and technology,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,2012 LinkedIn hack,
,In June 2012, ,cryptographic hashes, of approximately 6.4 million LinkedIn user ,passwords, were ,stolen, by ,hackers, who then published the stolen hashes online.,[160], This action is known as the ,2012 LinkedIn hack,. In response to the incident, LinkedIn asked its users to change their passwords. ,Security experts, criticized LinkedIn for not ,salting, their password file and for using a single iteration of ,SHA-1,.,[161], On May 31, 2013 LinkedIn added ,two-factor authentication,, an important ,security, enhancement for preventing hackers from gaining access to accounts.,[162], In May 2016, 117 million LinkedIn usernames and passwords were offered for sale online for the equivalent of $2,200.,[163], These account details are believed to be sourced from the original 2012 LinkedIn hack, in which the number of user IDs stolen had been underestimated. To handle the large volume of emails sent to its users every day with notifications for messages, profile views, important happenings in their network, and other things, LinkedIn uses the Momentum email platform from Message Systems.,[164],
,In 2014, Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) discovered that Threat Group-2889, an ,Iran,-based group, created 25 fake LinkedIn accounts. The accounts were either fully developed personas or supporting personas, and they use spearphishing or malicious websites to comprise victims' information.,[165],[,third-party source needed,],
,According to reporting by ,Le Figaro,, France's ,General Directorate for Internal Security, and ,Directorate-General for External Security, believe that Chinese spies have used LinkedIn to target thousands of business and government officials as potential sources of information.,[166],
,In 2017, Germany's ,Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, (BfV) published information alleging that ,Chinese, intelligence services had created fake ,social media, profiles on sites such as LinkedIn, using them to gather information on German politicians and government officials.,[167],[168],
,
,Moving emails to LinkedIn servers,[,edit,],
,At the end of 2013, it was announced that the LinkedIn app intercepted users' emails and silently moved them to LinkedIn servers for full access.,[169], LinkedIn used man-in-the-middle attacks.,[170],
,
,Privacy policy,[,edit,],
,The German ,Stiftung Warentest, has criticized that the balance of rights between users and LinkedIn is disproportionate, restricting users' rights excessively while granting the company far-reaching rights.,[171], It has also been claimed that LinkedIn does not respond to consumer protection center requests.,[172],
,In November 2016, Russia announced its intention to block the network in its own country, as it ""illegally stores data of Russian users on servers abroad."" The relevant law had been in force there since 2014.,[173],[174],
,
,Potential 2018 breach, or extended impacts from earlier incidents,[,edit,],
,In July 2018, Credit Wise reported ""dark web"" email and password exposures from LinkedIn. Shortly thereafter, users began receiving extortion emails, using that information as ""evidence"" that users' contacts had been hacked, and threatening to expose pornographic videos featuring the users. LinkedIn asserts that this is related to the 2012 breach; however, there is no evidence that this is the case.,[175],
,
,International restrictions,[,edit,],
,In 2009, ,Syrian, users reported that LinkedIn server stopped accepting connections originating from ,IP addresses, assigned to Syria. The company's customer support stated that services provided by them are subject to US export and re-export control laws and regulations and ""As such, and as a matter of corporate policy, we do not allow member accounts or access to our site from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria."",[176],
,In February 2011, it was reported that LinkedIn was being ,blocked in China, after calls for a "",Jasmine Revolution,"". It was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access ,Twitter,, which had been ,blocked, previously.,[177], After a day of being blocked, LinkedIn access was restored in China.,[178],
,In February 2014, LinkedIn launched its Simplified Chinese language version named "",领,英,"" (,pinyin,: ,Lǐngyīng,; ,lit.,: 'leading elite'), officially extending their service in China.,[179],[180], LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with Chinese rules, but he also said the benefits of providing its online service to people in China outweighed those concerns.,[179],[181], Since Autumn 2017 job postings from western countries for China aren't possible anymore.,[182],
,On 4 August 2016, a Moscow court ruled that LinkedIn must be blocked in Russia for violating a new ,data retention, law, which requires the user data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country. This ban was upheld on 10 November 2016, and all Russian ISPs began blocking LinkedIn thereafter. LinkedIn's mobile app was also banned from ,Google Play Store, and ,iOS App Store, in Russia in January 2017.,[183],[184],
,
,SNA LinkedIn,[,edit,],
,The Search, Network, and Analytics (SNA) team at LinkedIn has a website,[185], that hosts the ,open source, projects built by the group. Notable among these projects is ,Project Voldemort,,,[186], a ,distributed, key-value ,structured storage, system with low-,latency, similar in purpose to Amazon.com's ,Dynamo, and ,Google,'s ,Bigtable,.
,
,Surveillance and NSA program,[,edit,],
,In the ,2013 global surveillance disclosures,, documents released by ,Edward Snowden, revealed that British Government Communications Headquarters (,GCHQ,) (an intelligence and security organisation) infiltrated the Belgian telecommunications network ,Belgacom, by luring employees to a false LinkedIn page.,[187],
,
,Science,[,edit,],
,Massive amounts of data from LinkedIn allow scientists and machine learning researchers to extract insights and build product features.,[188], For example, this data can help to shape patterns of deception in resumes.,[189], Another example shows how signals from LinkedIn can be used to assess the ,quality, of ,Wikipedia, articles and their sources.,[190],
